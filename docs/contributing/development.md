# Development setup

Getting a working OpenRAL development environment from scratch — local Ubuntu, dev container, or GitHub Codespace — plus the day-to-day commands.

---

## System requirements

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04 | Ubuntu 24.04 (ROS 2 Jazzy) |
| Python | 3.12 (only — `pyproject.toml` pins `>=3.12,<3.13`) | 3.12 |
| RAM | 8 GB | 16 GB |
| Disk | 20 GB free | 40 GB free |
| GPU | CPU-only (limited) | NVIDIA, 8 GB VRAM |
| Docker | 24+ (for dev container) | 26+ |

macOS 14+ is supported for Python/tooling work. ROS 2 on macOS runs inside the dev container.

---

## Option A — Local Ubuntu machine (fastest iteration)

### 1. Clone and bootstrap

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral
cd OpenRAL
just bootstrap          # installs uv, ROS 2, system deps (~5–10 min)
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash   # or 'humble' on Ubuntu 22.04
just sync               # install Python workspace deps (always `just sync`,
                        # never bare `uv sync` — see toolchain.md)
```

The bootstrap script auto-detects Ubuntu 22.04 (→ ROS 2 Humble) or 24.04 (→ ROS 2 Jazzy).

### 2. Verify the install

```bash
just test            # full unit suite, <30 s
just lint            # ruff + mypy --strict; expect no errors
uv run openral doctor     # diagnose host environment
```

Test inventory (file + LOC counts, gaps, follow-ups):
[`tests/README.md`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/tests/README.md).

`uv run openral doctor` is the canonical environment probe — sample output
table in the [README's "Quick start" section](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/README.md#quick-start).
Each row reads `ok` / `info` / `absent` / `missing` depending on which deps
are installed.

---

## Option B — Dev container (VS Code / Docker Desktop)

### Prerequisites

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- Docker Desktop 24+ running locally

### 1. Open in container

```
F1  →  "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
```

VS Code will build `Dockerfile.dev` (first build ~8 min; subsequent builds use the layer cache) and run `uv sync --all-packages` automatically.

### 2. Or use docker-compose directly

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d openral-dev
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec openral-dev bash
# inside container (always `just sync`, never bare `uv sync`):
just sync
just test
```

The compose file also starts a **Jaeger** container for OpenTelemetry traces at `http://localhost:16686`.

!!! note "Hardware access"
    The dev container is started with `--privileged` and `/dev` mounted. On Linux hosts this gives USB access to connected robots. On macOS/Windows Docker Desktop, hardware passthrough is limited — use Option A (native Ubuntu) for hardware-in-the-loop work.

---

## Option C — GitHub Codespaces (browser / no local install)

1. On the GitHub repo page: **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main**.
2. Wait for the container to build and `uv sync --all-packages` to complete (~5 min).
3. Open a terminal and run `just test`.

!!! note
    Hardware mounts (`/dev`, `/run/udev`) are not available in Codespaces. All unit and sim tests work; HIL tests require a self-hosted runner.

---

## Day-to-day commands

All commands use `just` as the task runner. Run `just` (no arguments) to list all targets.

### Python tests

```bash
just test                   # all tests in tests/unit/
just test-k so100           # filter by keyword
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_schemas_fuzz.py -v   # run a specific file
```

### Linting and formatting

```bash
just lint       # ruff check + ruff format --check + mypy --strict (CI parity)
just fmt        # auto-fix: ruff format + ruff check --fix
```

### Schema export

```bash
just schema-export          # regenerate docs/reference/schemas/*.json
uv run python tools/schema_export.py --check   # CI drift-check (exit 1 on drift)
```

If you change any Pydantic model in `python/core/`, run `just schema-export` and commit the updated JSON files.

### ROS 2 build and test

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
just ros2-build             # colcon build --merge-install
source install/setup.bash
just ros2-test              # colcon test + colcon test-result --verbose
just test-ros-live          # the live-ROS pytest suite (see below)
```

`just ros2-build` first runs `scripts/check_ros_build_deps.sh`, which derives
the required ament packages from the in-tree `package.xml` files and reports
any that are not installed under `/opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/share`, with a ready
`apt-get install` line. Without it a single missing apt package (say
`ros-jazzy-octomap-msgs`) surfaces ~45 s in as a CMake `find_package` error
that aborts every remaining package, burying the cause. The check is
advisory — set `OPENRAL_ROS_DEPS_STRICT=1` to make missing deps fatal — and
no-ops when ROS 2 is not sourced.

#### The live-ROS suite (`OPENRAL_TEST_ROS_LIVE`)

A set of integration tests — the reasoner node's dispatch, VRAM and async-LLM
paths, the Tier-C critic producer, and the HAL sim-sensor bridge's
mobile-base `/tf` guard — needs more than an importable `rclpy`:
a real DDS graph and the colcon-built `openral_msgs` / `openral_reasoner_ros` /
`openral_prompt_router` overlay. They are gated behind `OPENRAL_TEST_ROS_LIVE=1`
so the ordinary `uv run pytest` run (where rclpy + DDS init can clash with a
glib pulled in transitively by torch/pyarrow) does not trip over them.

`scripts/ros_live_tests.sh` holds the target list and sets the variable. Both
callers exec it, so they cannot select different tests:

| Caller | Environment |
| --- | --- |
| `just test-ros-live` | your host, after `just ros2-build && source install/setup.bash` |
| `docker-build` workflow, "Live ROS tests" step | inside `openral:x86`, which bakes ROS 2 Jazzy + the colcon overlay |

No GPU is required — the free-VRAM readings are pinned at the `nvidia-smi`
process boundary. Pass extra pytest flags through the recipe, e.g.
`just test-ros-live -k dispatch_watchdog`.

Adding a live-ROS test means adding its file to `TARGETS` in that script — the
one place that decides what runs — and to the `paths:` filter in
`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`, so a diff touching only that test still
triggers the build that runs it. `tests/unit/test_ros_live_targets.py` fails the
unit suite if a gated file under `tests/integration/` is missing from `TARGETS`.
The `docker-build` workflow is the only CI surface with a real ROS 2 install;
the `test-selective` runner has none, so anything not listed there silently
`importorskip`s in CI — and a live test parked under `tests/unit/` runs on no
lane at all, which is why they live in `tests/integration/`.

That workflow runs on **merge to `master`**, not on pull requests (a full image
build is ~15-20 min of runner time). Run it yourself with `just test-ros-live`
while developing, or dispatch the workflow against your branch
(`gh workflow run docker-build.yml --ref <branch>`) before merging a change to
these tests.

One live test — `tests/unit/test_gstreamer_perception_tee.py`'s end-to-end
publish — is deliberately excluded: it also needs PyGObject, which the open
deploy image does not ship (the GStreamer media stack is OpenRAL Pro). `just
test` runs it on a host that has the `gstreamer` extra installed.

#### The RoboCasa sim suite (manual — there is no CI lane, and there cannot be)

Seven tests under `tests/sim/` are gated on `importorskip("robocasa")` and need
three things at once: the colcon overlay (they spawn the real
`safety_kernel_node`), MuJoCo, and a provisioned RoboCasa kitchen backend. They
are the geometry-and-kernel evidence behind issues #102 and #108 — the layout
pins, the certified distance instrument, the support-contact witness, the depth
synth, and the HAL's camera / body-twist paths on a real kitchen.

`scripts/robocasa_sim_tests.sh` holds the target list, and `just
test-robocasa-sim` is its only caller:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash && just ros2-build \
  && source install/setup.bash && just test-robocasa-sim
```

A fresh venv may lack `robocasa` even after `just sync`. Provision it with:

```bash
OPENRAL_AUTO_INSTALL_DEPS=1 uv run --no-sync python -c \
  "from openral_sim._deps import ensure_backend_deps; ensure_backend_deps('robocasa_kitchen')"
```

Run the suite before merging anything that touches the kernel, the
`panda_mobile` manifest, the HAL sim bridge, or a `scenes/deploy/robocasa_*.yaml`
pin. Narrow it with `-k` on a busy machine — a kitchen compose is memory-hungry
and the whole suite in one pytest process has OOM-killed a 15 GB host. Extra
args are appended to the pytest invocation, so naming a path *adds* it to the
target list rather than selecting it: use `just test-robocasa-sim -k
geom_distance`.

**Why there is no CI lane.** Two independent reasons, both measured.

*Disk.* RoboCasa's assets are 23 GB — `objects/aigen_objs` 13 GB,
`objects/objaverse` 6.2 GB, `objects/lightwheel` 1.5 GB, `fixtures` 1.4 GB,
`generative_textures` 1.2 GB, `textures` 521 MB — downloaded per-bundle from
utexas.box.com with no sub-bundle granularity. The only hosted CI surface with
a colcon overlay is the `docker-build` image, already 25.2 GB, building on a
runner that has to `rm -rf` dotnet, android and CodeQL to reclaim its ~14 GB.
Even a trimmed set (fixtures + textures + one object bundle, ~8 GB) is past
that runner's whole disk. No GPU is needed, so the constraint is disk alone.

*Security.* A self-hosted runner was built, registered, and then removed: it is
not a safe option for this repository. **A runner label is a routing request
made by a workflow, not an access control enforced by the runner.** A repository-scoped
self-hosted runner accepts jobs from *any* workflow in that repository naming
its labels, and for a `pull_request` event GitHub executes the workflow
definition from the **fork's** ref. `OpenRAL/openral` is public and has four
fork-reachable `pull_request` workflows (`dco.yml`, `quality.yml`,
`test-selective.yml`, `test-ros2.yml`), so a fork PR can edit one to
`runs-on: [self-hosted, <label>]` with arbitrary `run:` steps and execute code
on the runner host — with that user's SSH keys, `gh` credentials and LAN access
to the lab robots. Restricting a runner to selected workflows requires an
organisation runner group, which this org's GitHub Free plan does not offer, so
no native control makes the label mean anything.

Note what does *not* help: giving the protected workflow safe triggers. The
exposed asset is the runner, not the workflow. Reasoning about the triggers of
the file you are adding is the mistake that makes this look safe.

**What holds the suite together instead.** `tests/unit/test_robocasa_sim_targets.py`
fails the unit suite if a RoboCasa-gated file is missing from `TARGETS`. With no
CI lane, that list is the only definition of what the suite is, and that guard
is the only thing that notices when a test drifts out of it — which is exactly
what happened to `test_kernel_fridge_layout_pin_start_state.py` between #224 and
#232.

The rest of `tests/sim/` is manual by declared policy
(`.github/workflows/test-selective.yml`).

### Sim evals (closed-loop, opt-in — needs HF weights ± GPU)

```bash
just sim-eval scenes/<name>.yaml   # canonical entry point
just sim-libero                              # SmolVLA × LIBERO
just sim-xvla-libero                         # xVLA × LIBERO
just sim-pi05-libero                         # π0.5 × LIBERO (≥8 GB VRAM)
just sim-metaworld --task metaworld/reach-v3 # SmolVLA × MetaWorld MT50
just sim-act-aloha                           # ACT × gym-aloha bimanual cube
just sim-diffusion-pusht                     # Diffusion Policy × gym-pusht (CPU)
```

### Docs

```bash
just docs                   # serve at http://localhost:8000 (live-reload)
just docs-build             # full build (CI parity, strict mode)
```

## Making a pull request

1. Create a branch: `git switch -c feat/your-feature`.
2. Make your changes. Run `just lint && just test` before pushing.
3. If you changed a Pydantic schema, run `just schema-export` and commit the updated JSON files.
4. Open a PR. The title should follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) — e.g. `feat(core): add FooSchema`.
5. All CI checks must be green before merge. See `.github/workflows/` for what runs.

The full PR checklist is in the repo-root `CLAUDE.md` (not linked from docs — open it directly in your editor).

## Troubleshooting

### `uv sync` fails with "package not found" (or "Unable to uninstall hf-libero")

Run **`just sync`** instead of any bare `uv sync`. The workspace has multiple
member packages (the root manifest does not list them as direct dependencies),
so the sync needs `--all-packages` — which `just sync` supplies — and the
`just sync` wrapper also runs `scripts/repair_hf_libero_install.py` before/after
to avoid the `hf-libero==0.1.3` distutils-uninstall abort. Add opt-in groups
with `just sync --group <name>`. See
[Managing the Python environment & dependency
groups](toolchain.md#managing-the-python-environment-dependency-groups).

### `mypy` reports "missing library stubs or py.typed"

Both `openral_core` and `openral_cli` ship `py.typed` markers. If mypy still complains, make sure you ran `just sync` and that your interpreter is the workspace venv (`which python` should point into `.venv/`).

### `openral doctor` shows ROS 2 as "missing" after bootstrap

Source the ROS 2 setup file:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash   # Ubuntu 24.04
# or
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash  # Ubuntu 22.04
```

Add this line to your `~/.bashrc` for permanent effect.

### Docker build fails copying `python/core/pyproject.toml`

Make sure you're building from the **repo root** (the `docker-compose.dev.yml` sets `context: .`). Building directly with `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .` from the repo root also works.

### Pre-commit hooks fail

Install the hooks once after cloning:

```bash
just install-hooks
```

Then `git commit` runs ruff, ruff-format, mypy, codespell, and the
conventional-commit check on changed files automatically, plus DCO auto-sign-off.

Use `just install-hooks` rather than `pre-commit install`: the repo pins
`core.hooksPath=.githooks` (for DCO sign-off), and `pre-commit install` refuses
to run while `core.hooksPath` is set. `just install-hooks` instead wires the
committed `.githooks/` wrappers (which call `pre-commit run`) and pre-builds the
hook environments.
