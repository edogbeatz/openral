# Toolchain cheatsheet

Always use `just` and `uv`. **Never** `pip install` inside the workspace — use `uv add <pkg> --package <member>`. **Never** call `colcon build` outside `just` unless you know why.

## Bootstrap (Ubuntu 22/24, macOS 14+)

```bash
just bootstrap                  # installs uv, ROS 2, system deps via scripts/
```

## Python workspace

```bash
just sync                       # resolve & install all workspace deps
                                # (wraps `uv sync` + scripts/repair_hf_libero_install.py)
just sync --group robocasa      # + an opt-in dep group (sim / libero / robocasa / rldx / …)
                                # → read "Managing the Python environment & dependency
                                #   groups" below before swapping groups or running RoboCasa
just test                       # run unit tests (<30 s)
just test-doctest               # run docstring examples on the curated set
uv run pytest -k so100          # filter by keyword
just lint                       # ruff check + ruff format --check + mypy --strict
                                # (via tools/run_mypy.sh: openral_core, openral_cli,
                                #  openral_sim, openral_observability, openral_runner,
                                #  openral_reasoner, openral_wam, openral_hal, tools/)
uv run ruff check . --fix       # autofix
uv run ruff format .            # format
```

## Managing the Python environment & dependency groups

Read this before touching the venv — these are the rules that keep a working
tree, in priority order.

**1. Always `just sync`, never bare `uv sync`.** The Justfile `sync` recipe
wraps [`scripts/repair_hf_libero_install.py`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/scripts/repair_hf_libero_install.py)
**before and after** the sync and forces `--all-packages` for you. Bare
`uv sync` skips the repair and trips on:

```
error: Unable to uninstall hf-libero==0.1.3. distutils-installed distributions
do not include the metadata required to uninstall safely.
```

which aborts the resolve and leaves the venv half-broken (missing `h5py`,
`transformers`, `scipy`, …). `just sync` is idempotent and safe on every host.

```bash
just sync                       # the only correct full-workspace sync
```

**On aarch64 Linux, `just sync` needs `download.pytorch.org` reachable.** PyPI's
aarch64 torch wheel is CPU-only, so the root `pyproject.toml` pins torch +
torchvision to the `cu128` index (and raises `nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu12`) under a
`platform_machine == 'aarch64'` marker; without it every in-process policy runs
on CPU on a DGX Spark / Jetson. x86_64 resolution is untouched and never
contacts that host. Upgrading an *existing* aarch64 venv also needs a one-time
`uv sync --frozen --reinstall-package torchvision`, because both torchvision
builds share the version string. Full detail →
[aarch64 CUDA hosts](../reference/aarch64-support.md).

**2. Opt-in dependency groups → `just sync --group <name>`.** The
`[dependency-groups]` in `pyproject.toml` define `sim`, `libero`, `robocasa`,
`metaworld`, `maniskill3`, `rldx`, … Heavy runtime deps — `transformers>=5.4.0,<5.14.0`,
`scipy`, `opencv`, robosuite — live in these groups, **not** in the core deps.
A default sync (no `--group`) deliberately *removes* them, so for any VLA / sim
work you need at least the `sim` group:

```bash
just sync --group sim           # minimum working VLA / sim baseline
just sync --group libero        # LIBERO suites
just sync --group robocasa      # RoboCasa robosuite + supporting deps
just sync --group metaworld     # MetaWorld
just sync --group maniskill3    # ManiSkill3 / SAPIEN
```

`just sync --group robocasa` is exactly `uv sync --all-packages --group robocasa`
— the wrapper supplies `--all-packages` so the editable `openral-*` members are
never silently uninstalled (a bare `uv sync --group <x>` drops them and the next
`openral …` can't `import openral_core`).

**3. The libero ↔ robocasa conflict — swap groups per task.** LIBERO pins
`robosuite==1.4` + a specific MuJoCo; RoboCasa needs `robosuite>=1.5` + a
different MuJoCo. They are declared mutually exclusive in `pyproject.toml`
(`[tool.uv] conflicts`) and **cannot** coexist in one resolution — a
`uv sync --group libero --group robocasa` fails by design. You **swap** the
active group per task:

```bash
just sync --group robocasa      # before a RoboCasa run
just sync --group sim           # (or --group libero) to go back to LIBERO/MuJoCo
```

**4. RoboCasa itself is installed editable AT RUNTIME — not by `just sync`.**
The `robocasa` group only provides robosuite + supporting deps. The RoboCasa
kitchen fork (a GitHub repo, no PyPI release) is git-cloned and
`uv pip install -e --no-deps`'d by
`openral_sim._deps.ensure_backend_deps('robocasa_kitchen')`, which the
deploy-sim HAL triggers from `on_configure`. Auto-install is **on by default**
(`OPENRAL_AUTO_INSTALL_DEPS` unset or `=1`; set `=0` to prompt instead). So the
correct way to run a RoboCasa scene is to let the HAL provision it:

```bash
OPENRAL_AUTO_INSTALL_DEPS=1 openral deploy sim \
  --config scenes/deploy/robocasa_navigate.yaml
```

`deploy sim` takes no `--rskill`: the reasoner picks the active rSkill
dynamically from the in-tree `rskills/` palette at `on_configure`. The scene
YAML is the only policy input.

Do **not** hand-install `robocasa` / `robosuite` yourself — that pulls the wrong
robosuite and wrecks the managed env.

**5. Pre-build to skip the in-`on_configure` install window.** Provision the
RoboCasa clone once, ahead of time, so the lifecycle transition doesn't stall
on a first-run build:

```bash
OPENRAL_AUTO_INSTALL_DEPS=1 just sync --group robocasa
OPENRAL_AUTO_INSTALL_DEPS=1 python -c \
  "from openral_sim._deps import ensure_backend_deps; ensure_backend_deps('robocasa_kitchen')"
```

**6. Never `uv sync --all-packages` to "repair" the RoboCasa env.** Once the
runtime-editable RoboCasa install is in place, a plain `uv sync --all-packages`
*uninstalls* it (and the matching robosuite) and breaks the env. Repair with the
group re-applied — `just sync --group robocasa` — and, if RoboCasa itself was
evicted, re-run the `ensure_backend_deps('robocasa_kitchen')` line from point 5.

## ROS 2

```bash
just ros2-build                 # colcon build (msgs + hal_so100 + world_state + reasoner_ros
                                # + prompt_router + safety + safety_watchdog + safety_kernel
                                # + human_estop + skill_ros)
just ros2-test                  # colcon test + colcon test-result --verbose
source install/setup.bash       # after build
```

**Adding a Python node? Commit it mode 100755.** `just ros2-build` passes
`--symlink-install`, so `install(PROGRAMS …)` *symlinks* the node into
`install/lib/<pkg>/` instead of copying it — which means CMake's "make it
executable on install" never happens and the libexec entry inherits the source
file's mode. `launch_ros` resolves `executable=` with `shutil.which()` over that
directory, gets `None` for a 0644 file, and raises `executable '<name>' not
found on the libexec directory` — abandoning the **entire** launch description,
not just the one node. A `chmod +x` alone is not enough (it leaves a 100644 blob
in the commit); use `git update-index --chmod=+x <file>`.
`tests/unit/test_ros_node_exec_bits.py` enforces this for every package.

## GPU motion planning — cuMotion (optional)

NVIDIA Isaac ROS **cuMotion** is a CUDA-accelerated MoveIt planning pipeline
(backed by cuRobo). The `rskill-moveit-*` family uses it automatically when the
host clears the GPU floor — `RobotCapabilities.supports_cumotion()`: **Ampere+
(compute capability ≥ 8.0), CUDA ≥ 13, ~8 GB VRAM** — by setting
`MotionPlanRequest.pipeline_id`; otherwise MoveIt keeps **OMPL**. No new rSkill,
no `move_group` re-launch — it is a per-request pipeline choice.

```bash
just bootstrap                  # auto-installs cuMotion when a capable NVIDIA GPU
                                # is present on jazzy (skipped on CPU hosts → OMPL)
```

Manual install (if you skipped bootstrap or added the GPU later):

```bash
# 1. Add NVIDIA's Isaac ROS apt repo (one-time):
#    https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/getting_started/isaac_apt_repository.html
# 2. Install the cuMotion MoveIt pipeline (self-contained C++/CUDA, no cuRobo pip):
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-isaac-ros-cumotion-moveit \
                 ros-$ROS_DISTRO-isaac-ros-cumotion-robot-description
# 3. Add the cuMotion pipeline to your moveit_config's planning_pipelines, then
#    generate the per-robot cuRobo collision config from the kernel's own geometry
#    (NVIDIA ships configs for franka / ur5e / ur10e; --emit-cumotion covers the
#    rest of the OpenRAL fleet):
openral collision lower --robot robots/<robot>/robot.yaml \
        --emit-cumotion robots/<robot>/cumotion_spheres.yaml --write
```

Isaac ROS 4.4+ cuMotion is a **self-contained C++/CUDA apt package** (ships a
native `libcumotion.so.1` and uses the CUDA 13 runtime) — there is **no Python
cuRobo to install** and no `uv`/`pip` group. The apt packages are the supported
path on OpenRAL's Python 3.12 + Jazzy stack. *Verified 2026-06-22 on an RTX 4070
(Ada): the planner node loads the panda config and solves a joint-space plan in
~0.12 s.* cuMotion never bypasses the safety kernel: planned trajectories still
replay through `/openral/candidate_action` and are validated waypoint-by-waypoint.

## Sim

```bash
just sim-eval <config>          # canonical config-driven entry point
                                # (`openral sim run --config FILE`)
just sim-libero                 # SmolVLA × LIBERO (real lerobot[libero]; needs GPU + MUJOCO_GL)
just sim-xvla-libero            # xVLA × LIBERO   (Florence-2 backbone)
just sim-pi05-libero            # π0.5 × LIBERO   (≥8 GB VRAM)
just sim-metaworld --task TASK  # SmolVLA × MetaWorld (e.g. --task metaworld/reach-v3)
just sim-act-aloha              # ACT × gym-aloha bimanual cube transfer
just sim-diffusion-pusht        # Diffusion Policy × gym-pusht (CPU)
just sim-custom                 # custom example — ACT × gym-aloha insertion
```

## Hardware-in-loop (requires connected robot + USB perms)

```bash
just hil so100                  # SO-100 HIL tests
                                # (UR / Franka / G1 HIL are planned)
```

## Docs

```bash
just docs                       # mkdocs serve at :8000
just docs-build                 # mkdocs build --strict (CI parity)
just schema-export              # regenerate JSON Schema (CI compares)
```

## CLI (`openral`)

`just quickstart` automatically installs a `~/.local/bin/openral` wrapper so you can run `openral` (or `openral <cmd>`) from any terminal without `just`. To install or re-install it independently (e.g. after moving the repo):

```bash
just install-cli
```

The wrapper sources the ROS 2 distro overlay and the colcon workspace overlay before delegating to `.venv/bin/openral`, so ROS 2 node/topic/action commands work transparently. Pure-Python commands (`openral doctor`, `openral detect`, etc.) still work even if ROS 2 is not yet built.

### Which checkout does `openral` run? (`OPENRAL_REPO_ROOT`)

The wrapper bakes in the checkout that generated it. That is the right default for a single clone, but it is a **provenance hazard** the moment you have two — a git worktree used for validation, say. Without an override the wrapper would exec the *generating* checkout's venv, colcon overlay and `robots/` manifests no matter where you invoked it from, so a run could be attributed to the wrong branch with nothing in the log to show it (this happened for real on a DGX Spark).

`OPENRAL_REPO_ROOT` is the escape hatch, and the behaviour is:

| Situation | What runs | What you see |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENRAL_REPO_ROOT` unset, cwd anywhere in one checkout | the baked-in checkout | nothing (unchanged) |
| `OPENRAL_REPO_ROOT=/path/to/checkout` | that checkout | `openral: repo root /path/to/checkout (OPENRAL_REPO_ROOT override; installed default …)` on stderr |
| `OPENRAL_REPO_ROOT` points at a tree with no executable `.venv/bin/openral` | nothing — exit 1 | an error naming the tree; it never falls back to the baked one |
| `OPENRAL_REPO_ROOT` unset, but cwd is inside a *different* checkout that has its own `.venv/bin/openral` | still the baked-in checkout | `WARNING: cwd is inside the OpenRAL checkout …, but this launcher is baked to …` on stderr |

So when you validate from a worktree, either export the override:

```bash
export OPENRAL_REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
openral deploy sim --config …          # stderr records the root that ran
```

…or re-run `just install-cli` from that worktree to re-bake the default. The stderr line is deliberate: it means a captured run log always names the tree that produced it.

Bare `openral` (no args) drops into an interactive REPL where subcommands run without the prefix (`sim run --config …`); pass a subcommand for one-shot mode in scripts/CI.

```bash
openral doctor                   # diagnose host: Python, OS, ROS 2 distro, GPU, USB
openral detect                   # auto-detect robot + sensors + GPU; write a full robot.yaml
openral connect --robot so100    # open a HAL connection (only so100 wired today)
openral calibrate camera --sensor S  # ros2 camera_calibration helper
openral install sim              # post-install opt-in dep groups
openral install ros              # run the packaged bootstrap_ubuntu.sh (sudo); no clone needed
openral install list             # show every known dep group
openral rskill install <hub-id>  # download an rSkill from HF Hub (license-gated)
openral rskill list              # list installed rSkills
openral rskill new <id>          # scaffold a new local rSkill from rskills/template/
openral sensor list              # browse the sensor catalog
openral sensor show <id>         # resolve a catalog entry to a SensorSpec/Bundle
openral benchmark run --suite S --rskill R  # run a benchmark suite (canonical eval producer)
openral benchmark report         # aggregate rskills/<id>/eval/*.json benchmark blocks
openral sim run --config FILE    # run a SimScene YAML end-to-end
```

## Tooling self-help

- **`openral` prints `AMENT_TRACE_SETUP_FILES: unbound variable` and exits?** Your `~/.local/bin/openral` predates the fix that sources the (not-`set -u`-safe) ROS 2 overlays with nounset disabled. Re-run `just install-cli` to regenerate it.
- **`openral` seems to run the wrong branch / wrong `robots/` manifests?** You are almost certainly in a second checkout while `~/.local/bin/openral` is baked to the first. Recent wrappers print a `WARNING: cwd is inside the OpenRAL checkout …` line for exactly this; fix it with `export OPENRAL_REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)` or by re-running `just install-cli` from the checkout you mean. If you see no warning at all, your wrapper predates the fix — regenerate it with `just install-cli`.
- **Python import unclear?** `uv run python -c 'import openral_<pkg>; print(openral_<pkg>.__file__)'`.
- **ROS 2 topic missing?** `ros2 topic list -t` in a `source install/setup.bash`-ed shell.
- **Schema diff?** `just schema-export` and check `git diff python/openral_core/schemas/`.
- **CI flake?** Re-run once. If it flakes again, triage with the `flake` label and don't merge.
- **Hardware test fails on a runner?** Check the runner's e-stop log first. Never push a "fix" that makes a hardware test pass without understanding why it failed.
- **Out of GPU memory?** Lower batch / quantize / use a smaller skill variant — never silently downcast or skip frames.
- **`uv sync` fails with "Unable to uninstall `hf-libero==0.1.3`. distutils-installed distributions..."?** The PyPI sdist for `hf-libero` drops a spurious top-level `*.egg-info` FILE next to the proper `.dist-info/` directory; uv then misclassifies the install as distutils-built. Run **`just sync <flags>`** instead of `uv sync <flags>` — the wrapper pre/post-runs `scripts/repair_hf_libero_install.py` to strip the bogus file + RECORD line. Idempotent and safe on every host.
- **`No module named 'openral_core'` after switching dependency groups?** You ran bare `uv sync --group <x>`. Without `--all-packages` that syncs only the workspace root and **uninstalls every editable `openral-*` member**, so the next REPL / `openral deploy sim` can't import the workspace. Always use **`just sync`**, which forces `--all-packages` for you (unless you scoped to a single `--package`/`-p`) — `just sync --group robocasa` is equivalent to `uv sync --all-packages --group robocasa`. Repair an already-broken venv with `just sync --all-packages`.
