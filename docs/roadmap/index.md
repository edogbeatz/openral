| Sensor adapters | 🟡 in flight — `openral_sensors` catalog (RealSense D435/D435i/D415, Logitech UVC, Luxonis OAK-D Pro, Robotiq FT 300-S) + launch-gen + ROS image publisher; full perception-head ROS package still planned |
| World State aggregator | ✅ shipped — 30 Hz tf2-aware snapshot, stale-sensor diagnostics, detected-objects lift |
| Persistent spatial memory (scene graph) | 🟡 in flight — durable advisory object/place/room/agent graph the S2 reasoner queries (recall/resolve) + CLIP open-vocab match; sqlite-vec persistence + ROS feeder pending |
| Skill base + runtimes | ✅ shipped — lifecycle node, `PyTorchRuntime`, `ONNXRuntime`, quantization registry, engine cache |
| rSkill manifest + loader | ✅ shipped — HF Hub packaging, `rSkill.from_pretrained`, license surface; sigstore provenance not yet implemented (unverified-provenance warning + `OPENRAL_REQUIRE_SIGNED_SKILLS` fail-closed gate) |
| SmolVLA, π0.5, xVLA, ACT, DP, MolmoAct2, RLDX-1 adapters | ✅ shipped — loaded, tested, embodiment-tag gated; GR00T N1.7 in-process (lerobot 0.6.0 `GrootPolicy`, NF4 backbone) — ✅ live LIBERO-spatial 5/5 |

| rosbag2 ↔ LeRobotDataset v3 bridge | ✅ shipped — `RolloutRecorder`, `LeRobotDatasetSink`, `openral dataset {push,from-bag}` |
| Reasoner (S2 LLM supervisor) | ✅ shipped — `openral_reasoner` core + `openral_reasoner_ros` node + `openral_prompt_router`; provider-selected LLM, typed tool dispatch, event-driven ticks; bounded-retry replanning live (full substitute/replan ladder partial) |
| Deploy ROS graph | ✅ shipped — `openral deploy {run,sim}` with HAL + safety + reasoner + world_state; dynamic skill dispatch + `/clock` publisher |
| Navigation stack (SLAM + Nav2) | ✅ shipped — `openral_slam_bringup` (slam_toolbox) + `openral_nav2_bringup` as reasoner-managed background services; `cmd_vel` → mobile-base HAL |
| World Action Model (WAM) | 🟡 protocol shipped — `WorldModel` Protocol + `NullWorldModel`; Cosmos / UnifoLM-WMA-0 / IRASim adapters planned (v0.3) |
| Object detection + spatial lift | ✅ shipped — `RosImageObjectDetectorNode`, 2D→3D object lift, RT-DETR + OmDet-Turbo detector rSkills, GStreamer perception bus; LocateAnything-3B wired via VLM sidecar + `locate_in_view` on-demand tool; scene-VLM `kind:vlm` |
| Geometric safety + watchdog | 🟡 in flight — chunk-rate safety pass-through + envelope checks (✅), deadman/E-stop forwarders + human-estop (✅ `openral_safety_watchdog` / `openral_human_estop`); self/world/voxel collision + OctoMap→voxel bridge in dev |
| C++ safety kernel | 🟡 in flight — deny-by-default allocation-free validator landed (n_dof / position / velocity / torque / cartesian / ee-speed + geometric collision), OTel spans; sim/HIL gate + LTTng pending |
| Org / publishing | 🟡 in flight — public repo + `master` branch protection ✅; lockstep SemVer computed from Conventional Commits by `release-please.yml` ✅ ([releasing](../contributing/releasing.md)); PyPI trusted-publishing live — 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 published for all 14 packages ✅. `release.yml` was dropped 2026-06-17; the GHCR release-image path returns as a purpose-built `release-image.yml` once ROS-in-CI infra exists |

Legend: ✅ done, 🟡 in flight, 🔵 planned, 🔴 blocked / outstanding.

## Next phases

- **M2** — Unitree G1 real-HW HAL (`unitree_sdk2`) + cerebellar (S0) C++ controller; `rt_bridge` shared-memory ring.
- **M3** — HIL bring-up on lab runners: UR5e/UR10e/Franka/Sawyer/ALOHA real-HW adapters + D435 smoke test (adapters landed; runners not yet registered).
- **v0.3** — WAM adapters (Cosmos Predict, UnifoLM-WMA-0, IRASim) behind the `WorldModel` Protocol; spatial-memory ROS feeder + sqlite-vec persistence.
- **v1.0** — Failure-anticipation as first-class; C++ safety-kernel sim/HIL hardening + LTTng; certifiable build.
