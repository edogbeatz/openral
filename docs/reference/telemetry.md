# Telemetry reference — spans, metrics, logs, instrumentation

Everything OpenRAL reports at runtime, where it comes from, how often it fires,
and where it surfaces. If a signal is not in this file, it does not exist; if it
is here and marked **not emitted**, the name exists but nothing produces it.

Names are normative and live in
[`openral_observability.semconv`](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/blob/master/python/observability/src/openral_observability/semconv.py) —
that module is the single source of truth, this page is its annotated index.

## How it flows

Every OpenRAL process calls `configure_observability(service_name=…)`, which
installs a `TracerProvider`, `MeterProvider` and `LoggerProvider` all pointed at
one OTLP endpoint, plus a structlog→OTel log bridge. During `openral deploy sim`
that endpoint is the **in-tree dashboard**, which is itself an OTLP receiver:

```
 nodes ──OTLP/HTTP──▶ openral dashboard :4318 ──▶ TelemetryStore ──▶ SSE ──▶ browser
   │                    /v1/traces  /v1/metrics  /v1/logs
   └──────────────▶ otel-collector ──▶ Jaeger (traces) / Prometheus (metrics)
```

So spans, metrics **and every log line** land in the same store that feeds the
operator's Event Log. That is why the banding rules below matter as much as the
signals themselves: without them the panel is unreadable.

With `--no-dashboard` and no `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, the whole SDK is a
no-op — no providers, no exporters, and structlog falls back to its console
renderer.

---

## Spans

**Event Log band.** `dashboard/store.py::_is_headline_span` decides the band:
ERROR status → `error`; else a name in `_HEADLINE_SPANS` (or with a headline
prefix) → `info`; else → `debug`. This is an **allow-list**, so a new span is
quiet until deliberately promoted. Every span is still indexed in full for
`openral replay` regardless of band — this only affects the operator's log view.

| Span | Layer | Emitted at | Frequency | Band | Surfaces in |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cli.command` | CLI | `observability/cli.py:91` | 1 / invocation | **info** | Event Log |
| `deploy.bringup` | all lifecycle nodes | `observability/lifecycle.py` (via `@log_lifecycle_errors`) | 1 / transition | **info** | Event Log |
| `rskill.execute` | rSkill | `rskill/base.py:266`, `rskill_runner_node.py:608` | 1 / goal | **info** | Event Log, rSkill card |
| `rskill.configure` | rSkill | `rskill/base.py:159` | per lifecycle | **info** | Event Log, rSkill card |

| `reasoner.skill_failure` | Reasoning | `reasoner_node.py:4890` | per failure | **error** | Event Log, failure counter |

> **Why the allow-list.** It replaced a deny-list that named only the three
> obvious 30 Hz spans and missed four more ticking at the same rate. Measured on
> one second of a real 30 Hz two-camera deploy, the Event Log took **121 info

> traffic contributes **0** info rows.

### `rskill.chunk_inference` attributes

Every span opened by `inference_span` (directly, or through the
`_vla_core.run_inference` seam) carries `inference.kind` and, when known,
`inference.chunk_index` / `inference.chunk_size` / `inference.engine` /
`inference.device`, plus `inference.duration_ms` recorded on close. Those six
have `semconv.py` constants; the RTC attribute below rides the helper's generic
`inference.`-prefixed `**attrs` path and has none.

| Attribute | Recorded at | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `inference.rtc_delay` | `rskill/_vla_core.py::run_inference` | Real-Time Chunking only: how many actions the consumer popped out of the `ActionQueue` while the *previous* inference ran — the prefix length the guidance freezes. It is the queue's **index delta**, not a latency estimate, so it stays correct in fast-forward sim as well as wall-clock deploy. `0` on the cold-start chunk (no previous tail). |

The attribute is written only when the executor threads an `inference_delay`
into `run_inference(call_kwargs=…)`, so its presence in a trace is also the
"RTC is on for this skill" marker. It stays on the span and never becomes a
metric label — the `openral.inference.duration` label set is closed to `kind`.

### The three event rings

Demoting the noisy spans stopped info being *generated*, but the main ring is
one FIFO shared with the debug stream, so the rows that remained were still
evicted within seconds. The store therefore keeps two protected lanes beside it,
and `snapshot()` merges all three deduped:

| ring | size | holds |
|---|---|---|
| `_events` | 200 | everything, including debug |
| `_error_events` | 64 | errors + fatals, plus `skill_failure` even when downgraded to warn |
| `_headline_events` | 64 | the remaining non-debug rows (`deploy.bringup`, `reasoner.tick`, `world.scene_objects` …) |

**The two lanes are separate on purpose.** Mirroring all non-debug traffic into
the single error lane let routine info evict the safety events those 64 slots
exist to preserve: `world.scene_objects` alone ran at ~0.10/s (it is
change-gated with a 60 s keepalive now, but the isolation argument stands for
any headline span), so the shared
lane fully cycled in ~11 minutes of an otherwise idle scene and a minute-one
`safety.violation` was gone by minute twelve — the exact "counter goes up, no
trace" failure the protected lane was added to prevent. One budget each means
neither class can starve the other.

## Span events

Attached to whichever span is active. Counted in the dashboard's Command band
where noted.

| Event | Emitted at | Meaning | Band |
|---|---|---|---|
| `openral.event.safety_violation` | `runner/base.py:302`, `deploy_runner.py:487`, `lifecycle_kernel.cpp` | Safety check rejected an action | error, counted |
| `openral.event.deadline_missed` | `runner/base.py:427` | Tick overran its cadence budget | error, counted |
| `openral.event.skill_failure` | `reasoner_node.py:4887` | Reasoner-published skill failure | error (→ warn while e-stop-latched), counted |
| `openral.event.sensor_stale` | `deploy_runner.py:387` | Sensor older than its age budget | counted |
| `openral.event.staleness_latched` | `world_state/aggregator.py` | World-state component **went** stale — only for a component that has had data. A never-received one is stale in `diag` and counted in `components_stale`, but has not latched: it never had a fresh state to fall from. Suppressing it removes a WARN that fired on every bringup (`world_state` subscribes before the HAL's first `joint_state`). | — |
| `openral.event.error_latched` | `world_state/aggregator.py:589` | World-state component latched an error | — |
| `openral.event.estop_requested` | `hal/lifecycle.py::_emit_estop_telemetry` | E-stop latched at the HAL | error, counted, protected lane |
| `openral.event.action_dropped` | — | **[not emitted](#declared-but-not-emitted)** | — |
| `openral.event.chunk_prefetch_hit` | — | **[not emitted](#declared-but-not-emitted)** | — |
| `openral.event.chunk_prefetch_miss` | — | **[not emitted](#declared-but-not-emitted)** | — |
| `openral.event.episode_closed` | — | **[not emitted](#declared-but-not-emitted)** | — |

## Metrics

Exported every `OPENRAL_OTEL_METRIC_INTERVAL_MS` (default **5000**). Label
vocabulary is a closed set (`semconv.py`); threshold hints ride as data-point
attributes and are stripped by the store so they cannot fragment a series.

| Metric | Type | Unit | Recorded at | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `openral.tick.duration` | Histogram | ms | `runner/base.py` | 30 Hz — **library-runner path only**, see below |
| `openral.inference.duration` | Histogram | ms | `observability/tracing.py::inference_span` | per inference, **every adapter**; label `kind` ∈ `foreground` \| `prefetch` \| `single` (`InferenceKind`, mypy-enforced) — a timing axis; chunk *shape* rides the span's `inference.chunk_size`, not the label |
| `openral.hal.read_state.duration` | Histogram | ms | `hal/lifecycle.py::_hal_duration_metric` + `deploy_runner.py` | 30 Hz, **both paths** |
| `openral.hal.send_action.duration` | Histogram | ms | `hal/lifecycle.py::_hal_duration_metric` + `deploy_runner.py` | per chunk, **both paths** |
| `openral.sensors.age_ms` | Histogram | ms | `deploy_runner.py:377` | 30 Hz × camera |
| `openral.world_state.staleness_ms` | Histogram | ms | `world_state/aggregator.py:560` | 30 Hz × component |
| `openral.tick.budget_violations` | Counter | — | `runner/base.py:352` | on breach |
| `openral.tick.deadline_misses` | Counter | — | `runner/base.py:420` | on breach — **every** miss, unlike the rate-limited log |
| `openral.safety.violations` | Counter | — | `runner/base.py:302`, `deploy_runner.py:495` | on violation |
| `openral.sensors.stale_reads` | Counter | — | `deploy_runner.py:394` | on stale read |
| `openral.sim.episode.count` | Counter | — | `sim/sim_runner.py:840` | per episode |
| `openral.sim.episode.success` | Counter | — | `sim/sim_runner.py:842` | per successful episode |
| `openral.world_state.components_stale` | UpDownCounter | — | `world_state/aggregator.py:578` | 30 Hz |
| `openral.system.cpu.utilization_pct` | UpDownCounter | % | `system_metrics.py:188` | 1 Hz |
| `openral.system.ram.used_mb` / `.total_mb` | UpDownCounter | MBy | `system_metrics.py:189-190` | 1 Hz |
| `openral.system.gpu.memory_used_mb` / `.total_mb` | UpDownCounter | MBy | `system_metrics.py:191-192` | 1 Hz |

The system metrics come from a 1 Hz daemon thread
(`start_system_metrics_collector`) started automatically by
`configure_observability`; it is a quiet no-op on hosts without `psutil` /
`pynvml`.

## Logs

All OpenRAL logging is `structlog`, bridged to OTLP. **Records below
`OPENRAL_LOG_LEVEL` (default `INFO`) are dropped before rendering or export.**

Rough shape of the deploy-relevant call sites: ~199 `info`, ~197 `warning`,
~73 `debug`, ~41 `error`.

### Hot-path sites worth knowing

| Site | Level | Fires at | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `runner/base.py:439,451` `inference_runner.deadline_missed[.drop]` | warning | up to 30 Hz | **Rate-limited** to one line per 5 s carrying `suppressed_since_last` + `worst_tick_ms`. WARNING is the one band an operator cannot filter away, and a too-slow host misses on every tick. |
| `world_state/aggregator.py:259-381` `world_state.*.updated` (7 sites) | debug | 30 Hz | Below the default floor. |
| `rskill/base.py:278` `skill.step` | debug | 30 Hz | Below the default floor. |
| `runner/safety.py:140` `safety.null_check` | debug | 30 Hz | Below the default floor. |
| `reward_monitor_node.py:424` reward score | info | 0.5 Hz | Also on the rSkill card's reward bar. |
| `reasoner/core.py:567` `reasoner.tick.selected` | info | per LLM tick | Rare and high-value — the tool the model chose. |
| `reasoner_node.py:2424,2454` tick-suppressed reasons | debug | sub-second | Correctly demoted. |
| `ros_image_detector_node.py:501-545` "continuous leg alive" | info | per frame | Already `throttle_duration_sec=5.0`. |
| `dashboard/app.py` write-control audit trail | warning | per operator write | Audit-by-design; keep at WARNING. |
| `rskill/_diagnostics.py:132,142,166` `phase_timer` | info | start/done + 15 s heartbeat | The model-load progress signal — see below. |
| `hal/sim_attached.py` `sim.task_success` / `sim.task_success_final` | info | per verdict change / 1 per session | Deploy-sim ground truth — see below. |

### The deploy-sim task-success signal

`openral deploy sim` runs its backend continuously, which suppresses the
simulator's own per-step task evaluation — so nothing in the deploy stack used
to state whether the scene's task (e.g. "cup placed in the sink") had actually
been completed. `SimAttachedHAL` therefore polls the backend's own predicate
(RoboCasa's per-task `env._check_success()`; `openral_sim.rollout.SimRollout`'s
optional `task_success` extension) once per `env.step` and reports it:

| Line | Fires | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| `sim.task_success` | every change of the verdict, both edges | `success`, `previous`, `first_success`, `scene_id`, `task_id`, `sim_time_ns`, `sim_time_s`, `step` |
| `sim.task_success_final` | once, at `disconnect` — reached by the lifecycle cleanup/shutdown transition **and** by `HALLifecycleNodeBase.shutdown_hal` on a signal teardown | `success`, `ever_succeeded`, `first_success_sim_time_ns`, `transitions`, `scene_id`, `task_id`, `sim_time_ns`, `steps` |
| `sim.task_success_probe_failed` | once, if the backend predicate raises | `error`, `error_type` — polling then latches off (no flood, no crash) |

Both edges are logged because RoboCasa success is **not latched**: an object
can be knocked back out of its receptacle, and a rising-edge-only record would
claim a success no longer held. A backend with no success predicate emits
nothing at all — "unknown" is never reported as failure.

The terminal line reaches **both** teardown paths. `rclpy` answers SIGINT by
shutting the context down and raising out of `spin` without requesting the
lifecycle `shutdown` transition, and `openral deploy sim` ends every session
exactly that way (`_terminate_launch_group` SIGINTs the launch's process
group) — so while `disconnect` was reachable only from `on_cleanup` /
`on_shutdown`, no real run ever emitted the verdict. `HALLifecycleNodeBase.shutdown_hal`,
called from the `finally` of both HAL `main()` factories, closes that gap; it
is idempotent with the transition path, so exactly one line is emitted either
way. A SIGKILLed process still emits nothing — the signal is uncatchable.

The logger name is `openral.sim.task_success`, deliberately dotted under
`openral.` so it propagates to the stdlib logger the OTel bridge is attached to
and reaches the dashboard Event Log. Each line is **also** mirrored to stdout as
`<event> <json>` (matching `sim.estop_ground_truth_snapshot`), because the
structlog record is exported but never printed in a launched HAL subprocess —
and a verdict that exists only inside the collector is not recoverable from a
validation run's artifacts.

Observability only: the verdict reaches the log and nothing else. It never
feeds termination, reset, reward, or the action path (CLAUDE.md §1.4).

`ROSSafetyViolation` is never caught except at the safety-supervisor boundary,
where it triggers E-stop plus a structured incident log (CLAUDE.md §5).

### The E-stop ground-truth signals

`SimSensorBridge` records every kernel stop, carried payload or not. Three lines,
all joined by `stop_seq`, all `error`-level, all emitted through the node logger
(so they land in a launched HAL subprocess's own stdout):

| Line | Fires | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| `sim.estop_ground_truth_snapshot` | every `/openral/estop`, when MuJoCo handles are live | `estop_ground_truth_snapshot(...)` (contacts, `nearest_*_pairs` probes + coverage, joint state, base TF) + `stop_seq` + the 3-deep `candidate_action_chunks` ring + the kernel's `CollisionEvidence` when it landed within 0.5 s |
| `sim.estop_ground_truth_evidence` | only when the evidence lost the publish race | `stop_seq`, `collision_evidence` — the snapshot is never delayed for it, since sim state must be captured at the stop instant |
| `sim.estop_initial_configuration` | only when the stop fired **before any action reached the HAL** | `violation: "initial_configuration"`, `stop_seq`, `candidate_chunks_seen`, `sim_time_s`, `nearest_robot_world_pair`, `detail` |

The kernel's own `CollisionEvidence` additionally carries `joint_positions_rad`
(#187) — the configuration forward kinematics was actually run on for the
reported `horizon_step`, serialized at `max_digits10` so it round-trips exactly.
For a *predicted* step that configuration exists in no other artifact, so
without it such a stop can only be adjudicated against the measured joints,
which is a different pose.

### Graded velocity scaling (#188)

Off by default (`collision_scale_proximity_m: 0.0`). When armed, an **accepted**
chunk near an obstacle is republished with its rate columns scaled, and that is
disclosed three ways:

| Signal | Where | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| `safety.velocity_scale` | `safety.check` span attribute | the scale in `(0, 1]` applied to this chunk |
| `safety.scale_slack_m` | `safety.check` span attribute | clearance above the gate margin that produced it |
| `safety.collision_scaled` | kernel log, **transition-gated** | scale, slack, band, control mode, `rskill_id` — emitted when the scale moves by ≥ 0.1 or the band is cleared, not per chunk (the accept path runs at 30–200 Hz) |
| `scaled` | `/diagnostics` key-value, 1 Hz | count of chunks republished slower. A subset of `passed`, never of `dropped` — a scaled chunk *was* accepted and executed. |

The `/diagnostics` counter is the continuous signal; the log line is the
transition. Reading only the log undercounts, by design.

Each pair inside `nearest_*_pairs` carries its own **proof**, not just a number:
`distance_m`, `distance_certified`, `distance_method`, `witness_a_xyz` /
`witness_b_xyz`, and `distance_bracket_m` when the geometry is bracketed rather
than exact. Each coverage block adds `certified_pairs`, `uncertified_pairs` and
`distance_instrument`. This is because `mujoco.mj_geomDistance` — which every
probe before 2026-08-25 used — returns confidently wrong values for RoboCasa
fixture geoms against `panda_mobile` collision meshes in two silent modes, and
a reader must be able to tell a defensible distance from an undefendable one
without re-running the round. A verdict may rest only on a certified pair
(`tools/validation_matrix.py::probe_is_distance_certified`); see
[the 2026-08-25 correction](collision-validation-evidence.md#2026-08-25-the-ruler-was-wrong-and-here-is-what-it-moves).

The third line exists because the first one, read alone, is indistinguishable
from an ordinary mid-task stop. `SimAttachedHAL.last_action_ns` is `0` until the
first `send_action` — the single choke point every real action passes, stamped
*before* any early return — so `last_action_ns == 0` at a stop means the
configuration the kernel refused is the one the **scene reset produced**. The
robot is not doing something unsafe; it was *spawned* somewhere unsafe, and no
policy, chunk, or margin change can clear it: the remedy is a scene-config one
(a different seed, or pinned `backend_options.layout_ids` / `style_ids`).

The 2026-08-22 `robocasa/PickPlaceFridgeShelfToDrawer` seed-1 round is the case
that motivated it — an E-stop at sim `t=4.85 s` with zero chunks applied and
`robot0_link6` 0.000 m from `fridge_main_group_freezer_door`, which read as a
policy failure for a full debugging round.

`candidate_chunks_seen` is reported but deliberately does **not** gate the
classification: a chunk the kernel *rejected* never reached `send_action`, so
that stop is still at the initial configuration.

Diagnostics only (CLAUDE.md §1.4). The stop itself is correct and is neither
suppressed, delayed, nor altered — an initial pose that interpenetrates the
scene is exactly what the kernel exists to refuse. All the line does is name it.

### The RoboCasa scene composition

`robocasa_scene_composition` — `structlog`, `info`, once per `reset`, emitted by
`openral_sim.backends.robocasa._RoboCasaSim`.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `scene_id` | the scene that was built, e.g. `robocasa/PickPlaceFridgeShelfToDrawer` |
| `effective_layout_id` | the kitchen floor plan RoboCasa **actually** composed, 1..60 |
| `effective_style_id` | the style it actually composed, 1..60, or `"custom"` for a style dict |
| `pinned_layout_id` / `pinned_style_id` | what the scene YAML pinned, or `null` when it left the pool open |

RoboCasa redraws `(layout_id, style_id)` from `env.rng` inside
`Kitchen._load_model` on **every** reset, so the composition is a property of
the episode, not of the built env — which is why the line is emitted at reset
rather than at scene-factory time.

It exists because the seed alone does not identify the kitchen. Layout, style,
fixtures, `rack_index`, door-open amounts and the robot spawn deviation are all
drawn from one shared `env.rng`, so any upstream change to the draw order
reshuffles the scene at the same seed. Without this line a round's artifacts
never state which of the 60 kitchens ran, and two rounds are not comparable
even when both say `seed: 1`.

When the YAML pinned exactly one layout or style, a mismatch between pinned and
effective is a `ROSConfigError`, not a log line. The pin can be silently
overridden two ways upstream — the task's `EXCLUDE_LAYOUTS` / `EXCLUDE_STYLES`
filters the pinned id out of the pool, or a replayed `_ep_meta` carries its own
`layout_id` / `style_id` and wins outright — and both would otherwise run a
different kitchen than the scene file describes while every artifact still shows
the declared one.

## Load-phase instrumentation

`openral_rskill._diagnostics.phase_timer(name, *, prefix, gpu_mb=…)` wraps every
model-load phase and emits `<prefix>_<name>_{start,heartbeat,done}` with
`elapsed_s`, plus `rss_mb` and a major-fault delta, and optionally `gpu_mb`.
Heartbeat every 15 s so a long load is visibly progressing rather than hung.

> **It has a process-global side effect.** Entering the context manager raises

Standard phase names: `imports`, `from_pretrained`, `to_device`,
`processor_dir`, `make_processors`, plus family-specific quantisation/compile
phases. Per-adapter shortcuts live in the sim policies (`_smolvla_phase`,
`_pi05_phase`, `_molmoact2_phase`, `_groot_phase`).

`runtime_node` additionally emits `prewarm_vla_framework_*` for the one-time
torch + lerobot import, which **must** run before any camera reader thread
exists — see [`docs/methods/11-ros2-nodes.md`](../methods/11-ros2-nodes.md).

Offline phase breakdown for a single skill:

```bash
uv run tools/profile_policy_load.py --rskill rskills/<dir>
```

### Other instrumentation

| Mechanism | Where | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `DiagnosticsHeartbeat` → `/diagnostics` | `observability/diagnostics.py` | 1 Hz per lifecycle node |
| FailureTrigger bus → `/openral/failure/*` | `observability/failure_bus.py` | token-bucket rate-limited |
| LTTng tracepoints (8 pairs) | `observability/tracing_lttng.py` | **off**; `OPENRAL_ROS2_TRACING=1`, <300 ns when off |
| rosbag2/mcap ↔ OTel join | `observability/replay/` | `openral replay` |
| W3C traceparent propagation | `observability/propagation.py` | cross-process, parent trace preserved |

## Declared but not emitted

These names exist in `semconv` / `metrics` but **nothing produces them** (six, after `estop_requested` / `hal.estop.count` were wired and the
`inference.timeouts` contract was deleted with `ROSInferenceTimeout`, issue #49). They
are kept because each records an intended contract, and annotated in-place so
the modules do not read as an inventory of what actually works. A source-scanning
test (`python/observability/tests/test_declared_not_emitted.py`) pins this list
both ways, so wiring one up — or adding another — fails until this table is
updated.

| Signal | Why it is not just a missing `add(1)` |
|---|---|
| `openral.event.action_dropped` | `DeadlineOverrunPolicy.DROP` does drop the action, but reports via `deadline_missed` instead. |
| `openral.event.chunk_prefetch_hit` / `_miss` | Action-chunk prefetch runs but never reports its hit rate, so "is the prefetch helping?" cannot be answered from a trace. |
| `openral.event.episode_closed` | Intended to let a Jaeger query pivot from a skill execution to the produced dataset row; `RolloutRecorder` closes episodes without it, so that pivot does not work. |

**Removed: `openral.safety.clamps` / `safety.clamped`.** The attribute was
written in four places and was a literal `False` in every one; no code path ever
set it `True`. That is not an oversight — the *envelope* layer is deny-by-default
and `compute_intersection` "rejects (never clamps)" any envelope field that would
loosen the robot ceiling. The counter therefore measured an operation the system
did not perform, and the attribute cost a constant on every `safety.check` span
at 30 Hz. (HAL adapters *do* saturate commands into an actuator's physical range
— the Franka gripper maps `[0, 1]` onto its travel — but that is device
range-mapping, not a safety correction.)

**Since #188 the blanket claim "OpenRAL never clamps" is no longer true**, and
the replacement is deliberately a different signal rather than a revival of this
one. Distance-graded velocity scaling *does* modify a commanded value: an
accepted chunk near an obstacle is republished with its rate columns multiplied
by a scale in `(0, 1]`. It is reported by
`safety.velocity_scale` / `safety.scale_slack_m` (below), which carry *how much*
and *why*, where `safety.clamped` carried only a boolean. The envelope layer
still never clamps; what changed is that a second, separately-named mechanism
sits beside it.

**Fixed: the e-stop latch now self-clears.** `store.py` cleared
`topics.safety.estopped` only on `safety.severity == "ok"`, which no emitter has
ever produced — the C++ kernel sends `info` on a pass, `warn` while latched and
`violation` on a drop. The latch could only be set, never cleared, so the code
comment claiming it "self-corrects after a reset" was false and `estopped` stuck
true until an explicit `POST /api/estop_reset`. It now clears on a clean pass
from a real kernel, which is proof the kernel is not latched (it returns early
with `estop_latched` while `fault_latch_` is set). The null client is excluded:
it emits `info` unconditionally without checking anything, so treating that as
evidence of a clear would let a no-op client unlatch the UI. Dashboard-side
only — no safety code changed.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | *unset* → **full no-op** | Where traces, metrics and logs go |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` | gRPC | `http/protobuf` for the in-tree dashboard |
| `OPENRAL_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Log-record floor. Names or integers; unparseable falls back to the default rather than raising. Does **not** affect span bands. |
| `OPENRAL_OTEL_SAMPLE_RATIO` | always-on | Head-based ratio; `deploy`/`connect` set 0.1 in the CLI process |
| `OPENRAL_OTEL_METRIC_INTERVAL_MS` | 5000 | Metric export interval |
| `OPENRAL_OTEL_SPAN_SCHEDULE_DELAY_MS` | 30 | `BatchSpanProcessor` flush — ~1.3× the thumbnail rate so the dashboard does not alias |
| `OPENRAL_ROS2_TRACING` | off | LTTng tracepoints |
| `OPENRAL_JAEGER_UI_URL` | unset | Enables the trace deep-link in the dashboard header |
| `OPENRAL_DASHBOARD_WRITE_CONTROLS` | off | Enables `POST /api/skill/execute`, `/api/param/set`, and the Go2 demo bar (including Start/End Cricket) |
| `OPENRAL_CRICKET_IDLE_S` | `900` | Idle auto-End of the cricket GPU session; `0` disables. Running `ExecuteRskill` is not idle. |
| `OPENRAL_CRICKET_INSTANCE` | `abundant-turquoise-cricket` | Brev workspace name Start/End pass to `brev start` / `brev stop` |
| `OPENRAL_CRICKET_CONTAINER` | `openral-jazzy-go2` | Docker name on cricket |
| `OPENRAL_CRICKET_ROLE` | hostname contains `cricket` → `host` | `host` or `laptop`. Laptop Start may `brev start` and open SSH tunnels |
| `OPENRAL_CRICKET_FOXGLOVE_LOCAL_PORT` | `8765` | Laptop tunnel for Foxglove `ws://127.0.0.1:8765` |
| `OPENRAL_CRICKET_DASHBOARD_LOCAL_PORT` | `14318` | Laptop tunnel for cricket's `:4318` (this process keeps `:4318`) |
| `BREV_SSH_CONFIG` | `~/.brev/ssh_config` | SSH config used for cricket tunnels (`ControlMaster=no`) |
| `OPENRAL_CRICKET_HALT_HOST` | hostname contains `cricket` → on | After the graph dies, halt the VM so billing stops (`0` to leave that to `brev stop` from a laptop) |
| `OPENRAL_CRICKET_STOP_CMD` | unset | Optional override for the host-stop step (`brev stop` / halt) |

Sampling note: the 0.1 hardware ratio applies to the **CLI process only**. HAL
and other nodes call `configure_observability()` without a ratio, so their spans
are always-on even on real hardware.

| In-tree dashboard | OTLP/HTTP → `127.0.0.1:4318` | Default for `deploy sim`; SSE to the browser; MJPEG re-serve of thumbnails |
| otel-collector-contrib | OTLP → `:4317` | `docker-compose.dev.yml`; traces→Jaeger, metrics→Prometheus, logs→debug |
| Jaeger | via collector | UI on `:16686` |
| Prometheus | scrapes `otelcol:8889` | 5 s interval, 2 h retention |
| C++ safety kernel | its own OTLP/HTTP exporter | service `openral_safety_kernel`; no sampler configured (always-on) |
| rosbag2 / mcap | `openral replay` | joins bag ↔ `/api/traces` |

Service names on the wire: `openral` (CLI), `openral.runtime`,
`openral.hal.<robot>`, `openral.world_state`, `openral.reasoner`,
`openral.safety`, `openral.prompt_router`, `openral.reward_monitor`,
`openral_safety_kernel`.
