# `rskills/` — OpenRAL rSkill worked examples

This directory holds the **manifests** for a curated set of rSkills OpenRAL
ships as worked examples and test fixtures — the ones exercised by this
repo's tests, `openral deploy sim` scenes, and the docs. It is **not** the
catalog. The catalog is the [`OpenRAL` org on the Hugging Face
Hub](https://huggingface.co/OpenRAL); nothing needs to be added here to use
a skill that's published there. Each in-tree subdirectory is one rSkill: a
`rskill.yaml` manifest plus `README.md`, a discovery-only `SKILL.md`, and an
`eval/` folder. The subdirectories do **not** contain model weights — the
manifest's `weights_uri` points at the corresponding Hub repo, and the
weights are pulled on first load.

> **One rSkill ⇄ one HF repo.** Every entry below maps 1:1 to an
> `OpenRAL/rskill-<name>` repo on the Hub. The in-tree manifest is the
> source of truth; `tools/generate_rskill_skillmd.py` mirrors the
> discovery `SKILL.md` to each HF repo, and the org card counts are
> derived from this directory.

## Find rSkills on the Hub

`openral rskill search` is how you find an rSkill — it queries the `OpenRAL`
Hub org (server-side, filtered on the `rskill` model-card tag), fetches each
hit's manifest concurrently, and matches your query locally and
case-insensitively against the repo id, manifest name/description, family,
kind, role, embodiment tags, and Hub tags:

```bash
openral rskill search libero                                   # any field mentioning "libero"
openral rskill search --embodiment so101_follower               # facet filter, no query
openral rskill search --kind detector --license apache-2.0      # combine facets
openral rskill search --family pi05 --json                      # scriptable output
```

Each row's `local` column tells you what's already on this machine:
`in-tree` (a manifest with that name lives under `rskills/`), `installed`
(present in the local rSkill registry after `openral rskill install`), or
`—` (Hub-only — install it to use it). Then install and run it like any
other skill, in-tree or not:

```bash
openral rskill install OpenRAL/rskill-smolvla-franka_panda-libero_spatial-bf16
openral sim run --config scenes/sim/libero_spatial.yaml \
  --rskill OpenRAL/rskill-smolvla-franka_panda-libero_spatial-bf16
```

`--rskill` accepts a bare in-tree name, an `rskills/<id>` path, or a Hub
repo id interchangeably — a skill you found on the Hub does not need a
local manifest to run.

## How an rSkill resolves its weights

| `weights_uri` scheme | Where the weights live | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hf://OpenRAL/...` | Hugging Face Hub, fetched + cached on first load | every VLA / detector / VLM / reward skill |
| `local://rskills/...` | An ONNX file inside the rSkill dir, **gitignored** and reproduced via a `tools/export_*.py` script (also mirrored to HF) | `rtdetr-coco-r18` |

`rtdetr-coco-r18` is the deliberate `local://` exception: the GStreamer
perception path is ONNX-file-based, and `openral deploy sim` uses
`rskills/rtdetr-coco-r18/model.onnx` as its offline detector fallback. That
binary is listed in the repo `.gitignore` (`model.onnx`, `model.onnx.data`)
— the clone stays small; the file is regenerated locally on demand. The
heavier `rtdetr-v2-r50vd` variant (`runtime: tensorrt`) moved to the private
`openral-pro` repo — the commercial-tier split that hosts the TensorRT engine
runtime it depends on as an OpenRAL Pro plugin.

### Not on the Hub yet

Four in-tree manifests have no `OpenRAL/rskill-*` repo on the Hub, so they are
invisible to `openral rskill search` and cannot be installed by repo id (loading
them by in-tree name still works wherever their weights resolve). Each needs
only the wrapper repo published — their weights are third-party public
checkpoints, exactly as `act-aloha` and `smolvla-libero` already work:

| in-tree skill | weights | to publish |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lingbot-vla-4b-robotwin` | `robbyant/lingbot-vla-4b-posttrain-robotwin` | wrapper only |
| `lingbot-vla2-robotwin` | `robbyant/lingbot-vla-v2-6b` | wrapper only |
| `rskill-internvla_n1-mobile_base-vln-nf4` | `InternRobotics/InternVLA-N1-DualVLN` | wrapper only |
| `rskill-sam2_1-any-grasped_object_mask-bf16` | `facebook/sam2.1-hiera-small` | wrapper only |

Two OpenRAL-hosted NF4 prequant mirrors are also unpublished
(`lingbot-vla-4b-robotwin-nf4`, `lingbot-vla-v2-6b-nf4`). Both LingBot manifests
now point at the fp32 upstreams instead and pack NF4 at load, which is the path
their sidecar falls back to anyway; republishing the mirrors is a download-size
win and needs only a `weights_uri` repoint.

## Add your own rSkill

You don't need to add an entry here to run your own skill — install it from
any HF repo at load time. To scaffold a new local rSkill from
[`template/`](template/):

```bash
openral rskill new my-skill --family pi05 --embodiment-tag franka_panda
# or wrap an existing HF checkpoint:
openral rskill new my-skill --from-hf <owner>/<repo>
```

Then edit `rskills/my-skill/rskill.yaml`, `README.md`, and `SKILL.md`
(the publish validator rejects leftover `TEMPLATE_ID` / `TODO:` markers),
and publish with `tools/rskill_publisher.py`. See
[`template/README.md`](template/README.md) for the per-field walkthrough.

Publishing to the Hub — and making the repo public — is what makes a skill
discoverable: the publisher stamps the `OpenRAL` + `rskill` tags into the
model-card front matter, and `openral rskill search` lists the org filtered
on that `rskill` tag. There is no separate "list it in the catalog" step;
adding it to this directory is optional and only worth doing if the skill
should also serve as an in-tree test fixture or `deploy sim` example.
