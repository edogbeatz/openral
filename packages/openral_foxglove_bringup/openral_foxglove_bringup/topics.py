"""Bucket-1 allowlist + read-only capability set for the Foxglove bridge.

Kept in an importable module (not the launch file) so the safety invariants
can be unit-tested without spawning a ROS graph. See
``launch/foxglove.launch.py`` for how these are applied.

The allowlist is assembled from four named groups so a reader can tell at a
glance *why* a topic is exposed. All four are read-only observation; the
actuation/command plane (``/openral/estop``, ``/openral/safe_action``,
``/openral/candidate_action``, ``/openral/execute_rskill``,
``/openral/prompt``…) is absent from every group on purpose, and
``test/test_foxglove_launch.py`` proves it stays that way.

#: **Depth & reconstruction** — the RGBD / nvblox / visual-SLAM legs. Only
#: published when the matching deploy posture is on (``--enable-octomap``, a
#: ``slam_mono_camera`` scene, an nvblox graph); absent otherwise, in which
#: case the panels sit empty rather than erroring.

BUCKET2_TOPICS: list[str] = [

    r"/openral/world_voxels_cloud",  # sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 — occupied voxel centres
]

#: **Telemetry** — the mission/state plane the OTel dashboard also renders,
#: mirrored here so a Foxglove-only operator is not blind to it. Every entry
#: is an observation topic a node publishes *about itself*; none of them
#: commands anything, and the bridge advertises no ``clientPublish``
#: capability, so a viewer can read them and nothing more.
#:
#: ``/openral/world_state_fast`` is the densest of these: one
#: ``openral_msgs/WorldStateStamped`` carries joint state, base pose/twist,
#: end-effector poses, per-component diagnostics + staleness, battery, and the
#: detected-object list — most of the dashboard's "World state" card in a
#: single message, plottable field by field.
#:
#: Deliberately NOT here: ``/openral/safety_status``. It is read-only status
#: (the latched kernel state the dashboard's "Safety · current state" card
#: reads), so exposing it would leak no actuation — but it lives in the
#: safety plane this package promises never to advertise, so it stays out
#: pending safety-WG sign-off. The dashboard keeps rendering it either way.

#: Read-only capability set. Omits ``clientPublish``, ``services``,
#: ``parameters``, ``parametersSubscribe`` from the upstream default so the
#: viewer cannot publish, call services, or write params. ``connectionGraph``
#: powers Foxglove's Topic Graph panel; ``assets`` lets the 3D panel fetch
#: ``package://`` URDF meshes (a read-only fetch).
#: ``asset_uri_allowlist`` for the bridge's asset server — what a connected
#: viewer may fetch to render the URDF (meshes, textures).
#:
#: Upstream's default spells a directory segment ``[-\w%]+``, which admits no
#: dot. Enactic's OpenArm meshes live under
#: ``package://openarm_description/assets/robot/openarm_v2.0/meshes/...`` and
#: the ``openarm_v2.0`` segment carries one, so *every* mesh was refused
#: (``Asset URI not allowed``) and the 3D panel drew a bare TF tree with no
#: robot in it. Versioned asset directories are ordinary upstream practice, so
#: this is not OpenArm-specific.
#:
#: The dot is added to the directory class and path traversal is refused
#: explicitly by the leading negative lookahead instead — this list is the only
#: thing standing between a connected viewer and the deploy host's filesystem,
#: and ``..`` must stay unreachable however the rest of the pattern relaxes.
#: The extension set is upstream's, unchanged.
#: Mesh filename extensions the bridge may serve. Upstream's set, unchanged.
