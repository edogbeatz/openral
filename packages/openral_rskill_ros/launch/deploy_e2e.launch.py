r"""Generic end-to-end ROS graph for ``openral deploy sim``.

One launch file for every robot. Every robot-specific bit is a launch argument resolved inside
an ``OpaqueFunction`` so concrete strings reach ``LifecycleNode(package=, executable=, name=)``:

* ``robot_yaml`` — RobotDescription manifest path, loaded via Pydantic at launch time; the
  safety kernel envelope is synthesised from it
  (``openral_safety.envelope_loader.compute_intersection``) and forwarded as ROS parameters on
  the kernel node. No envelope YAML file is written or read.
* ``hal_package`` / ``hal_executable`` / ``hal_node_name`` — HAL spawn, picked by
  ``openral deploy sim`` from ``_ROBOT_HAL_REGISTRY[robot_id]``.
* ``hal_params_file`` — ephemeral ROS parameter YAML the CLI writes with the HAL's per-robot
  knobs (``/**`` wildcard).
* ``reset_to_pose_service``, ``dashboard_port``, ``reasoner_model``, ``reasoner_endpoint`` —
  shared knobs.

Spawned processes: dashboard + safety_kernel + runtime + reasoner + prompt_router + HAL.
Lifecycle nodes auto-transition UNCONFIGURED → INACTIVE → ACTIVE.

    **A finer grid is LESS conservative**, not more: the cell half-diagonal is
    the kernel's quantisation term, so shrinking it makes the kernel stop later
    and nearer. Sim ships **15 mm** as of #253's ruling; real hardware stays at
    50 mm.

    The sim evidence: replayed on the real kernel over identical payload poses,
    `PickPlaceCounterToSink` (the DOP-only, field-typical payload) goes from
    **154** false stops of 182 genuinely-clear poses at 25 mm with a
    box-lowered payload to **15** at 15 mm with #266's refinement -- 90% fewer,
    with all 7 real contacts still caught. Neither lever alone is worth much
    (12% and 10%); the terms ADD, so both have to move. See
    `docs/reference/collision-validation-evidence.md` and hazard-log Entry 027.

    **Real hardware ships 20 mm on that same sim evidence, and nothing else.**
    No real map has been measured at any resolution. Sim rasterises a kitchen's
    own solid geometry; a real map comes from a depth camera and is dilated by
    the octree->grid bridge, and `docs/reference/world-map-fidelity.md` is
    explicit that the live map stops MORE often than the rasterised one, never
    less. The quantisation term is also not the only thing between the payload
    and reality on hardware -- depth noise, extrinsics and the octree dilation
    sit beside it, and 50 -> 20 mm removes 25.98 mm of guaranteed margin while
    leaving those untouched. Recorded as a deliberate reduction in
    conservatism, gated on the safety-WG, in its own hazard-log entry. It
    should be re-measured on a real map before it is relied on.

    20 mm on hardware and 15 mm in sim, not one value, because the two maps
    have different error budgets and the sim one is the only one with numbers.

    Cell counts against `octree_to_grid.cpp`'s `kMaxCells` (4 000 000): sim
    15 mm is 141/axis = 2 803 221 (70% of the guard, and the finest value that
    ships without raising it -- 12.5 mm needs 4 826 809 and is refused); real

    The shipped ``config/openral_layout.json`` is generated for

    out of the robot manifest and the deploy scene, and they differ per robot
    (``top`` / ``context`` / ``wrist_left`` / ``camera1``…). A panel pointed at a
    slot this deploy has no publisher for renders "Image topic does not exist",
    which looks exactly like a dead camera. The 3D panels have the same
    problem one level up: they follow a TF frame, and Foxglove draws an empty
    scene — no robot, no point clouds, no markers — when that frame is not in
    the tree. The library default is the ROS-conventional ``base_link``, which
    OpenArm does not broadcast (its root is ``openarm_base``), so the robot's
    own ``base_frame`` is threaded through rather than guessed.

    ``compressed=True`` (the deploy default) points Image panels at the
    ``image_transport`` ``/compressed`` siblings — raw 640×480 RGB8 is
    ~9 MB/s/camera and saturates a laptop websocket. Pair with
    ``_foxglove_compressed_republishers``.

    A layout is imported client-side, so no launch argument can push one into

def _build_real_bringup_include(hal_package: str) -> object | None:
    """Include ``hal_package``'s vendor ros2_control bringup, if it ships one.

    Every real-hardware HAL in this repo publishes to controllers it does not
    start: ``controller_manager`` is C++ at 400 Hz+ and belongs under a vendor
    bringup launch, not under a Python HAL (CLAUDE.md §1.5). Until this include
    existed, ``deploy run`` assumed that graph was already up, so an operator
    brought it up out-of-band from a second terminal — which put a *second*
    ``/joint_states`` publisher on the bus and tripped the shared-graph guard
    (``openral_cli._dds_scope``, #227) on the documented bring-up path. Starting
    it here keeps that guard meaningful: one graph, one publisher, and no
    escape hatch needed to deploy a real robot — the occupied-graph refusal is
    now unwaivable (``openral_cli._dds_scope``).

    Returns ``None`` when the package ships no such file — the case for every
    HAL whose controller graph is started elsewhere (a vendor daemon, a
    robot-side controller) and for every sim-only HAL. Callers must only reach
    here on ``hal_mode == "real"``.

    No launch arguments are forwarded. The vendor launch's own defaults are
    required to agree with the HAL's constants already — that agreement is what
    ``tests/hil/test_openarm_bringup_agreement.py`` guards — so passing a second
    copy of the CAN interface names through here would create a way for the two
    to disagree without any test noticing.

    The include starts concurrently with the HAL lifecycle node, not before it.
    The HAL's ``connect()`` preflights the CAN links (up regardless of
    controllers) and does not block on ``/joint_states``, so for the few seconds
    the controllers take to spawn it logs ``read_state failed: Joint state is
    N s old`` and then recovers once the broadcaster is active. That is
    warn-only and self-healing; sequencing it behind a controller-active event
    handler would buy a quieter log and nothing else.

    A vendor bringup typically also spawns its own ``robot_state_publisher``,
    alongside the one this file derives from ``assets.urdf``. Both are kept: the
    manifest URDF is load-bearing (for OpenArm it carries ``openarm_base``, the
    ``world`` bridge and the sensor mounts, none of which the vendor xacro
    describes), so suppressing it loses frames something downstream reads.

    Their ``/tf`` output is additive only because both now spell joints and
    links the same way. It was not: the vendored OpenArm URDF used to strip the
    ``openarm_`` prefix, and two spellings of one robot on ``/robot_description``
    empty out ``joint_state_broadcaster`` (its ``use_urdf_to_filter`` publishes
    only joints the URDF also names) while freezing this node's tree at the rest
    pose, since none of its joint names match the arm's ``/joint_states``. Both
    failures are silent. The names are standardised upstream-side now, and the
    caller additionally keeps this node off ``/robot_description`` whenever a
    vendor bringup owns it — see the remapping at the node itself.
