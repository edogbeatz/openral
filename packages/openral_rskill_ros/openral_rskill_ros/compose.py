"""Single-process composer for rskill_runner + world_state.

Locks the contract that ``WorldStateAggregator`` is the *only* subscriber of
``/joint_states`` and bridges it in-process via ``.snapshot()`` to the rskill — which
requires the world_state lifecycle node and the rskill_runner_node to share **one**
aggregator instance in the same OS process so the snapshot call never crosses a ROS topic
boundary.

``compose_runtime`` is the single function both production launches and integration
tests call. It loads the robot's ``RobotDescription`` from its on-disk ``robot.yaml``
(CLAUDE.md §1.11 — real manifests under ``robots/``, never a placeholder), constructs one
``WorldStateAggregator``, hands the same instance by reference to
``_WorldStateLifecycleNode`` and ``RskillRunnerNode``, and returns both nodes for
the caller to attach to an ``rclpy.executors.MultiThreadedExecutor``.

Does **not** drive lifecycle transitions itself; the caller (launch file's ``runtime_node``
entry point or a test ``trigger_configure`` sequence) configures + activates after composing.

    Args:
        robot_yaml: Path to a ``robots/<id>/robot.yaml``, loaded via
            ``RobotDescription.from_yaml`` (full Pydantic validation). Relative or
            absolute; ``runtime_node`` passes an absolute path from the ROS parameter.
        skill_resolver: Optional override of the default production skill resolver. Tests
            pass a local-only resolver to avoid HF Hub network access; ``None`` runs the
            default ``rSkill.from_pretrained``-shaped resolver.
        skill_resolver_factory: Optional factory ``(host_node) -> SkillResolver`` for a
            resolver that closes over the just-constructed ``RskillRunnerNode`` — required
            for wrapped-ROS skills whose adapter needs the host rclpy node to create
            per-skill ActionClients on the same spin. Mutually exclusive with
            ``skill_resolver``.
        enable_world_cloud_bridge: When ``True``, attach a
            ``WorldCloudBridge`` so the octomap
            occupied voxel cloud (``/octomap_point_cloud_centers``) renders into the
            dashboard via the ``world.pointcloud`` OTel span family. ``False`` (default)
            skips the subscription cost when octomap is off.
        world_cloud_topic: PointCloud2 topic the world-cloud bridge renders. Empty keeps
            octomap's latched centers default; the mono visual-SLAM launch points it at
            nvblox's (VOLATILE) ESDF voxel cloud.
        slam_source_node: Node name stamped on the dashboard SLAM card's
            ``openral.slam.source_node`` attribute. Empty keeps the ``openral_slam_toolbox``
            default; the visual-SLAM launch sets ``openral_nvblox`` when nvblox builds
            ``/map``.
        dataset_out: When set, attach a
            ``DatasetRecorderBridge`` recording
            the deploy session (proprio + action + camera frames + episode markers) to this
            rosbag2 ``.mcap`` file (single file, not a bag directory; parent must exist, file
            must not). Segmented by the ``/openral/episode`` markers an *executing* rSkill
            emits, so a session with no skill run writes nothing (reported at ``destroy()``).
            Caller must call ``runtime.dataset_recorder_bridge.destroy()`` on teardown to
            finalize the bag. ``None`` disables recording.
        dataset_repo_id: repo_id stamped into the recorded frames / eventual LeRobotDataset.
            Defaults to ``openral/dataset-<robot>``.
        dataset_license: SPDX license carried into the offline ``openral dataset from-bag``
            conversion. Defaults to ``CC-BY-4.0``.
        dataset_fps: Recording cadence. Defaults to the robot's
            ``action_spec.control_freq_hz`` or 30.0.
        image_staleness_limit_s: Camera-specific freshness window for the shared world-state
            aggregator. ``None`` keeps its general default.

    Returns:
        A ``ComposedRuntime`` bundle. The caller attaches both nodes to a single
        ``rclpy.executors.MultiThreadedExecutor``, then drives the managed-lifecycle
        transitions.
