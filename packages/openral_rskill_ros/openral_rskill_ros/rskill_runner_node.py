"""F1 — `rskill_runner_node` lifecycle node.

Owns the ``openral_msgs/action/ExecuteRskill`` action server and the in-process
``openral_runner.DeployRunner`` mandated by the F1 design. One node per robot.

Action-goal lifecycle (CLAUDE.md §6.4 + the F1 design):

1. **goal_accept_cb** — resolve the rskill via a callable resolver (default
   ``openral_rskill.rSkill.from_pretrained``); license + capability gate; envelope gate
   against the configured ``RobotDescription``. Rejects (``ROSCapabilityMismatch`` /
   ``ROSConfigError``, CLAUDE.md §10) stamp both the prose ``failure_reason`` and the
   uint8 ``failure_kind`` for the reasoner's replanning ladder
   (``_failure_kind_for_exception`` maps the §5 hierarchy).
2. **execute_cb** — instantiate/reuse a ``openral_runner.DeployRunner`` with the
   ``openral_runner.ROSPublishingHAL`` sink and the shared
   ``openral_world_state.WorldStateAggregator``; run until completion or ``deadline_s``.
3. **cancel_cb** — drain the in-flight chunk (≤100 ms), then idle-hold the last commanded
   joint state. Runner stays ``active``, ready for the next goal.
4. **/openral/estop + /openral/safety_status subscriptions** — defense in depth alongside
   ``safety_node`` (CLAUDE.md §1.5); aborts with ``failure_reason="safety_estop"`` /
   ``failure_kind=FAILURE_SAFETY_ESTOP`` and transitions to ``inactive``. OR-ed into one seam,
   ``RskillRunnerNode._safety_abort_reason``, read by the ``ROSPublishingHAL`` apply-wait
   and (via ``RskillRunnerNode._raise_if_safety_aborted``) every other blocking wait on the
   dispatch path, so a latched safety layer is never reported as a generic timeout.

The action-goal path is the only way an external client triggers a rskill; the legacy CLI /
single-process invocation is a thin wrapper that sends a goal to this server.

    * If ``rskill_id`` is in the index, builds the runtime policy adapter via
      ``openral_sim.factory.make_policy`` (same path as ``openral sim run``) and wraps it in
      a thin ``rSkillBase`` shim so the skill_runner's lifecycle + embodiment-gate contract

    * Otherwise raises ``ROSConfigError`` listing the known skill ids — the reasoner's tool

    Args:

        tf_lookup: Forwarded to the inner ``_PolicyAdapterSkill`` so wrapped-task-space VLAs
            assemble ``observation.state`` from live TF + bindings at step time. ``None``
            preserves the joint-space path.
