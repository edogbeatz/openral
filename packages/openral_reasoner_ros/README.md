# `openral_reasoner_ros`

ROS 2 lifecycle wrapper for the OpenRAL S2 reasoner.

## What it does

A thin rclpy lifecycle node around
[`openral_reasoner.ReasonerCore`](../../python/reasoner/src/openral_reasoner/core.py).
Subscribes to:

- `/openral/world_state_slow` (`openral_msgs/WorldStateStamped`, 5 Hz)
- `/openral/failure/{hal,sensor,rskill,safety,wam,critic}` (`openral_msgs/FailureTrigger`)
- `/openral/perception/{motion,objects,ocr,scene_change}` (`openral_msgs/PromptStamped`)
- `/openral/prompt` (`openral_msgs/PromptStamped`)
- completion camera (`sensor_msgs/Image` on `completion_camera_topic`; deploy
  launch sets this from the HAL RGB names — Go2 is
  `/openral/cameras/front/image`, not the tabletop `top` default)

Jazzy: a second lifecycle `activate` while already `active` used to raise
`RCLError` and exit the node. The wrapper ignores that redundant transition
so `startup_prompt` still has a subscriber.

Since the 2026-05-25 amendment the reasoner is **event-driven** with a slow
heartbeat: the periodic timer ticks at `tick_hz` (default 0.2 Hz = one every
5 s). Event preemption is the primary trigger:

- `/openral/failure/safety` (Tier A) preempts on `severity ≥ SEVERITY_WARN`.
- `/openral/failure/{hal,sensor,rskill,wam,critic}` (Tier B/C) preempts
  on `severity ≥ SEVERITY_FAIL`.
- `/openral/prompt` (Tier D) always preempts.

All preemptions are subject to the 100 ms min-interval.
Heartbeat ticks that see no new event since the last successful tick
are short-circuited inside `ReasonerCore` with
`suppressed_reason="heartbeat_idle"` — **except while an
`execute_rskill` goal is in flight**, when the heartbeat stays live so
the reasoner can poll `query_task_progress` mid-execution. The retry
cap is keyed on the **identical tool call** (same tool + same
arguments): a healthy navigate → pick → place sequence never trips it,
a verbatim repeat does, and after a capped streak further
unchanged-context ticks are held *before* the LLM call
(`suppressed_reason="retry_cap_hold"`) until new context arrives.

Each tick the LLM picks one typed tool call
([`openral_core.ReasonerToolCall`](../../python/core/src/openral_core/schemas.py)).
The effect/actuation variants:

| Tool | Dispatch target | What's wired today |
|---|---|---|
| `ExecuteRskillTool` | action goal on `/openral/execute_rskill` (F1) | ✅ `rclpy.action.ActionClient` — sends a goal with `deadline_s`, streams feedback to the warning log, emits a `FailureTrigger` on `/openral/failure/rskill` with `KIND_CONTROLLER` (rejection / abort / server-unavailable) or `KIND_TIMEOUT` (deadline_s expired). One goal at a time: while a goal is in flight a second dispatch is refused with feedback and the context carries an `in_flight:` line |
| `LifecycleTransitionTool` | service call on `<node>/change_state` | ✅ generic `lifecycle_msgs/srv/ChangeState` client — `configure` / `activate` / `deactivate` / `cleanup` only (`shutdown` reserved for the safety supervisor, CLAUDE.md §6 Layer 6) |
| `EmitPromptTool` | publish on `target_topic` | ✅ publishes on the call's `target_topic` (per-topic publisher cache; `/openral/prompt` reuses the cascade publisher); stamps the active OTel `traceparent` into `metadata_json` |
| `WaitTool` | none (deliberate no-op) | ✅ the forced tool choice needs an explicit "observe and wait" option — logged with its rationale, no ROS traffic |
| `ReloadGstPipelineTool` | service call on `/openral/sensors/<id>/reload_pipeline` | ⚠️ log-and-acknowledge stub — F6 sensor-package service IDL is not yet on disk (tracked in [GH-126](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral/issues/126)) |

**Mission handling on `/openral/prompt`:** an operator prompt (re)builds the
mission queue only when no mission is in progress. Mid-flight, a prompt is
*guidance* (reaches the LLM via PROMPTS context) unless `metadata_json`
carries `{"new_goal": true}` (`openral prompt --new-goal "..."` stamps it).
The reasoner's own cascade re-prompts (`spatial_memory` / `detector` /
`scene_vlm` / `reward_monitor` / `memory` / `mission` frame_ids) never rebuild
the mission and never reset the search budgets or retry-cap streak.

**Crash-safe ladder resume:** set the `ladder_state_path` ROS parameter to a
writable JSON path and the mission ledger + every replanning-ladder bound
(attempts, subdivision offers, decompose nudges, per-task locate budget) is
snapshotted after each mutation and restored at `on_configure`. Empty
(default) disables persistence.

**Dispatch-phase watchdog:** `_rskill_inflight` (the one-goal-at-a-time busy
latch) is bounded by `dispatch_watchdog_s` (default 30 s; `<= 0` disables): if
neither the VRAM-peer eviction nor the goal response resolves within the
ceiling (a runner/peer died after the readiness probe; rclpy futures never
time out on their own), the watchdog releases the latch, reactivates the
peers, and emits a `KIND_CONTROLLER` FailureTrigger
(`state="dispatch_timeout"`). The expired dispatch generation invalidates its
remaining callbacks; a late accepted goal is canceled and cannot overwrite a
newer dispatch.

The reasoner **never** publishes `openral_msgs/ActionChunk` — actuation
authority lives behind the F1 action server + the F5 safety boundary
("Holds no authority over actuation").

## Reasoner model registry

Reasoner selection is **model-first** (ADR-0088). The primary knob is
`OPENRAL_REASONER_MODEL`, a key in the curated
[`openral_core.REASONER_MODELS`](../../python/core/src/openral_core/schemas.py)
registry. Registry membership means the model has cleared OpenRAL's robotics
tool-calling contract; there is deliberately no separate compatibility flag.
The registry resolves the wire dialect, served model id, default endpoint,
auth requirement, hosting mode, and local-compute floor.

| `OPENRAL_REASONER_MODEL` | Served model | Client | Hosting / endpoint | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `claude-opus-4-8` | `claude-opus-4-8` | `AnthropicToolUseClient` | Anthropic cloud | required |
| `gpt-5.5` | `openai/gpt-5.5` | `OpenAICompatibleToolUseClient` | OpenRouter cloud | required |
| `gpt-5.6` | `openai/gpt-5.6` | `OpenAICompatibleToolUseClient` | OpenRouter cloud | required |
| `cosmos3-edge` | `nvidia/Cosmos3-Edge` | `Cosmos3ToolUseClient` | managed local `http://127.0.0.1:8901/v1` | none |

The env contract is:

- `OPENRAL_REASONER_MODEL` — required registry key, or a raw model id for the
  explicit uncurated escape hatch.
- `OPENRAL_REASONER_ENDPOINT` — optional URL override. Location lives here,
  not in a provider name. For an OpenAI-dialect cloud model, an override means
  the operator owns auth policy for that endpoint; Anthropic-compatible
  endpoints still require a key.
- `OPENRAL_REASONER_API_KEY` — required only when the resolved endpoint needs it.
- `OPENRAL_REASONER_MAX_TOKENS` / `OPENRAL_REASONER_TIMEOUT_S` — optional
  per-call overrides. The `ollama` / `vllm` named endpoints cap a call at
  **60 s**; a large local model on a long-running mission reaches that ceiling
  (`tick error: … Request timed out`), and `OPENRAL_REASONER_TIMEOUT_S` is the
  way past it. Before raising it, read `llm_s` / `prompt_tokens` on the tick
  (below) — a ceiling hit driven by a growing prompt wants context management,
  not a longer timeout.
- `OPENRAL_REASONER_DIALECT=anthropic|openai` — required only for an uncurated
  raw model id.

```bash
# Curated cloud model
export OPENRAL_REASONER_MODEL=gpt-5.5
export OPENRAL_REASONER_API_KEY=sk-or-...

# Curated managed-local model
export OPENRAL_REASONER_MODEL=cosmos3-edge

# Uncurated escape hatch: explicit and warned by the factory + doctor
export OPENRAL_REASONER_MODEL=qwen3:8b
export OPENRAL_REASONER_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434/v1
export OPENRAL_REASONER_DIALECT=openai
```

`OPENRAL_REASONER_MAX_TOKENS` defaults to `16384` for the curated GPT-5.x
entries so OpenRouter does not reserve their full output window and reject a
low-balance request with HTTP 402. Anthropic keeps its client default. Managed
Cosmos gets a 120 s first-call timeout for kernel compilation.

For `cosmos3-edge`, a down managed endpoint auto-starts
`tools/cosmos3_reasoner_sidecar.py`; disable with
`OPENRAL_COSMOS3_AUTOSTART=0`. `OPENRAL_COSMOS3_BOOT_TIMEOUT_S` bounds first
boot. An explicit `OPENRAL_REASONER_ENDPOINT` points the same curated model at
a self-managed vLLM/NIM endpoint.

### Legacy migration

The old `OPENRAL_REASONER_LLM_{PROVIDER,MODEL,API_KEY,BASE_URL,...}` contract
was **removed in 0.3.0** (deprecated in 0.2.0 per ADR-0088). It is no longer
read at all: an environment that sets only the old vars now fails with
"`OPENRAL_REASONER_MODEL` is unset" rather than silently selecting a model.

Each var maps across directly:

| Legacy | Model-first |
|---|---|
| `OPENRAL_REASONER_LLM_PROVIDER` + `OPENRAL_REASONER_LLM_MODEL` | `OPENRAL_REASONER_MODEL` (+ `OPENRAL_REASONER_ENDPOINT`) |
| `OPENRAL_REASONER_LLM_BASE_URL` | `OPENRAL_REASONER_ENDPOINT` |
| `OPENRAL_REASONER_LLM_API_KEY` | `OPENRAL_REASONER_API_KEY` |
| `OPENRAL_REASONER_LLM_MAX_TOKENS` | `OPENRAL_REASONER_MAX_TOKENS` |
| `OPENRAL_REASONER_LLM_TIMEOUT_S` | `OPENRAL_REASONER_TIMEOUT_S` |

`PROVIDER` split into two axes — *which model* and *where it runs* — so each
old provider value maps onto a model plus an endpoint:

| Legacy `PROVIDER=` | Model-first replacement |
|---|---|
| `anthropic` | curated `claude-opus-4-8`, or `ENDPOINT=anthropic` + a raw model id |
| `openrouter` / `gemini` / `xai` / `deepseek` / `huggingface` | `ENDPOINT=<name>` + `API_KEY` |
| `ollama` / `vllm` | `ENDPOINT=<name>` (no key) |
| `cosmos` | curated `cosmos3-edge` (managed autostart included) |
| `openai-compatible` | `ENDPOINT=<url>` + `DIALECT=openai` |

A named endpoint carries its own base URL, dialect, auth posture, cold-start
timeout and `tool_choice` quirk, so `DIALECT` is needed only for a bare URL.

Tests use a deterministic `FakeToolUseClient` under
[`tests/integration/fakes/`](../../tests/integration/fakes/) — the only test
double permitted at this process boundary per CLAUDE.md §1.11.

## System prompt

The base system prompt (`openral_reasoner.DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) is a
robot-agnostic operating brief: one-tool-per-tick semantics, faithful
adherence to the operator goal, robot/scene-matched skill selection,
locate-before-manipulate (`recall_object`), navigate-to-approach
(`resolve_place` / Nav2 navigation skills), per-tick progress evaluation,
and observe-but-never-bypass safety/e-stop handling ("Python proposes,
C++ disposes").

At `on_configure` the node calls
[`resolve_reasoner_system_prompt`](../../python/reasoner/src/openral_reasoner/tool_use.py),
which composes:

1. **Base brief** — `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, unless
   `OPENRAL_REASONER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` is set to a non-empty value (whitespace-only
   counts as unset), which replaces it.
2. **`## THIS ROBOT` block** — appended by `render_robot_context_prompt` from
   the active robot's `RobotCapabilities` (`robot_yaml` ROS parameter, or the
   `robot_capabilities` constructor arg): embodiment tags, whether it can
   locomote (gates the navigate-to-approach rule), manipulation/sensing
   hardware, payload, and control modes.

With no robot wired the prompt stays at the (possibly overridden) base brief
alone.

## Curated reasoner models

The library factory has no default and refuses to guess. `openral deploy sim`
does default to `OPENRAL_REASONER_MODEL=gpt-5.5`, with
`OPENRAL_REASONER_MAX_TOKENS=16384`; it was the most reliable model in live
collective-goal decomposition tests. The default needs
`OPENRAL_REASONER_API_KEY` and fails loudly without it.

### Cloud — GPT-5.5 / GPT-5.6 via OpenRouter

```bash
export OPENRAL_REASONER_MODEL=gpt-5.5  # or gpt-5.6
export OPENRAL_REASONER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
uv add openai --package openral-reasoner
```

### Cloud — Claude Opus 4.8

```bash
export OPENRAL_REASONER_MODEL=claude-opus-4-8
export OPENRAL_REASONER_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
uv add anthropic --package openral-reasoner
```

### Managed local — NVIDIA Cosmos 3 Edge

[Cosmos 3 Edge](../../docs/reference/cosmos3-edge-reasoner.md) (released
2026-07-20) is the 4B on-device tier of NVIDIA's Cosmos 3 omnimodal
world-model family, built for exactly this job: physical reasoning, task
planning, and embodied decision making on Jetson Thor / RTX-class GPUs. Unlike
the general-purpose LLM baselines above it is a *physical-AI-native* planner —
trained on robotics/AV/warehouse data, with spatial grounding and
physical-plausibility judgment — and its `describe_image` completion gate runs
on the same local model (no separate cloud VLM). Weights are
**OpenMDW-1.1** (commercial use OK). One env var is enough; the managed vLLM
server auto-starts on the first tick (first boot downloads ~8 GB):

```bash
export OPENRAL_REASONER_MODEL=cosmos3-edge
uv add openai --package openral-reasoner      # one-time (client SDK only)
```

Requires an NVIDIA GPU (Ampere+; BF16 is the only officially-tested
precision; **≥12 GB recommended**). An 8 GB 4070 was enough for validation,
but the knobs differ by serving stack: the pinned stable stack needed
`OPENRAL_COSMOS3_GPU_MEM_UTIL=0.95` merely to boot (inference remains blocked);
the working vLLM-main native implementation needed expandable CUDA segments
plus `--kv-cache-dtype fp8`. Pre-warm the pinned sidecar with
`python tools/cosmos3_reasoner_sidecar.py`, or point
`OPENRAL_REASONER_ENDPOINT` at a compatible self-managed server.

> ⚠️ **Live status (2026-09-07): works on linux-aarch64; still blocked on
> x86_64.** Read the two platforms separately — the lock resolves a *different
> vLLM* for each, and only one carries the native Edge model
> ([vllm#48291](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/48291)).
>
> * **aarch64 (Jetson AGX Thor, vLLM 0.28.0): working.** The architecture
>   resolves natively, the server serves, and a `tool_choice="required"` tick
>   returned a **validated tool call at 1.26–1.36 s warm** — inside the 0.2 Hz
>   budget. The first tool-call request costs ~64 s while xgrammar builds the
>   grammar, so the first tick after boot blows a 5 s budget; later ones do not.
> * **x86_64 (vLLM 0.24.0): still blocked.** That release predates the native
>   model and crashes on inference via the Transformers-fallback
>   `get_rope_index` bug. On a nightly it worked (validated tool call ~1.5 s on
>   an 8 GB 4070, `--kv-cache-dtype fp8`). **Use a curated cloud model there
>   until the x86 branch resolves a vLLM with #48291.**
>
> Getting there needed three sidecar fixes, all landed: the `--universal` lock

> the native loader, which reads the diffusers layout by path; and FlashInfer's

### Uncurated local endpoint — explicit escape hatch

Models outside `REASONER_MODELS` are not claimed compatible. They still work
when the model id, endpoint, and dialect are explicit; the factory and doctor
warn that robotics tool-calling reliability is unverified.

```bash
just bootstrap-ollama
export OPENRAL_REASONER_MODEL=qwen3:8b
export OPENRAL_REASONER_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434/v1
export OPENRAL_REASONER_DIALECT=openai
```

## Synopsis

```bash
just ros2-build      # builds openral_msgs + openral_reasoner_ros
source install/setup.bash

# One curated model, e.g.:
export OPENRAL_REASONER_MODEL=claude-opus-4-8
export OPENRAL_REASONER_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

ros2 run openral_reasoner_ros reasoner_node
ros2 lifecycle set /openral_reasoner configure
ros2 lifecycle set /openral_reasoner activate
```

## Observability — what to expect on the dashboard

Each `ReasonerCore.tick` opens an OTel span named `reasoner.tick`
(see `openral_observability.reasoner_span`) with these attributes:

| Attribute | When set | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `reasoner.tick.idx` | Always | Monotonic per-`ReasonerCore` tick counter. |
| `reasoner.model` | When the client has a `model_id` | LLM model identifier (e.g. `claude-opus-4-7`). |
| `reasoner.force` | Always | `True` when the tick was preempted by `FailureTrigger.severity ≥ FAIL` or a new operator prompt. |
| `reasoner.tool` | Successful + retry-cap suppressed ticks | Which of the four `ReasonerToolCall` variants the LLM picked. |
| `reasoner.rskill_id` | When tool=`execute_skill` | Skill id the LLM chose. |
| `reasoner.suppressed_reason` | Suppressed ticks | One of `palette_empty` / `retry_cap` / `heartbeat_idle`. The `min_interval` and `heartbeat_idle` short-circuits fire BEFORE the span opens (so dashboards don't show noise). |
| `reasoner.tier` | Always | Trigger tier that drove this call: `A` (safety), `B` (replan: hal/sensor/rskill/wam), `C` (critic), `D` (operator/perception), or `heartbeat`. |
| `reasoner.mission_json` | When a mission is active | `MissionState.to_summary()` JSON — the ordered task queue (id/text/status/attempts/verdict) the live dashboard renders as the Mission card checklist. Absent on bare-goal deploys. |
| `reasoner.error_kind` | Provider failure | `ROSPlanningError` subclass name; an `exception` event is added to the span. |
| `reasoner.llm_s` | Every tick that reached the LLM | Wall-clock of the provider round-trip **alone**. `ReasonerTickResult.elapsed_s` is end-to-end tick time (context render + call + bookkeeping), so `elapsed_s - llm_s` is the reasoner-side overhead — without the split a tick that grew from 6 s to 99 s cannot be attributed. |
| `reasoner.prompt_tokens` | When the client reports usage | Provider-reported prompt tokens (Anthropic cache reads included). Tick latency that grows in step with this is a context-size problem — window or summarize the history rather than raising `OPENRAL_REASONER_TIMEOUT_S`. |

`reasoner.llm_s` and `reasoner.prompt_tokens` also appear on the
`reasoner.tick.selected` structured log, readable without opening Jaeger.

The active W3C `traceparent` captured inside this span is threaded onto the
outbound `EmitPromptTool` `PromptStamped.metadata_json` so the F7 bag↔OTel
correlator can join the published prompt back to the producing tick.

Spans are emitted via `opentelemetry-sdk`; a no-op (cost <1 µs) when
`configure_observability` was not called (no provider installed). The
`just docker-smoke-x86-reasoner` smoke installs a real provider so the
round-trip can be observed end-to-end inside the deploy image.

## CLAUDE.md amendment

CLAUDE.md §3's dual-system pattern specifies **direct typed
`ReasonerToolCall` dispatch** as the reasoner's output contract: the LLM
picks exactly one typed tool call per tick and the node routes it onto the
ROS graph.
