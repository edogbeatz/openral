"""ROS 2 reasoner + supervisor graph — ``reasoner_node`` lifecycle wrapper.

Subscribes: ``/openral/world_state_slow`` (``WorldStateStamped``, 5 Hz),
``/openral/failure/{hal,sensor,rskill,safety,wam,critic}`` (``FailureTrigger``),
``/openral/perception/{motion,objects,ocr,scene_change}`` (``PromptStamped``),
``/openral/prompt`` (``PromptStamped``, operator).

Heartbeat tick at ``tick_hz`` (default 0.2 Hz). Out-of-band tick on a
``FailureTrigger`` with ``severity>=SEVERITY_FAIL`` (``>=SEVERITY_WARN`` on
``/openral/failure/safety``, Tier A) or a new ``/openral/prompt``, subject to
``ReasonerCore``'s 100 ms min-interval (reasoner+supervisor
design §4). Idle heartbeats short-circuit with ``suppressed_reason="heartbeat_idle"``.

Dispatches ``ReasonerToolCall``:

* ``ExecuteRskillTool`` → action goal on ``/openral/execute_rskill`` (F1
  ``rskill_runner_node``); ``FailureTrigger`` on ``/openral/failure/rskill``
  (``KIND_CONTROLLER`` on reject/abort/unavailable, ``KIND_TIMEOUT`` past
  ``deadline_s``).
* ``LifecycleTransitionTool`` → ``<node>/change_state``
  (``lifecycle_msgs/srv/ChangeState``); ``"shutdown"`` is deliberately absent
  from the palette (CLAUDE.md §6 Layer 6).
* ``ReloadGstPipelineTool`` → ``/openral/sensors/<sensor_id>/reload_pipeline``.
  **Deferred**: F6 sensor-package IDL not yet on disk; logs a warning and acks.
* ``EmitPromptTool`` → republish on the target ``PromptStamped`` topic.

Never publishes ``openral_msgs/ActionChunk`` (reasoner+supervisor design §4:
"Holds no authority over actuation").
