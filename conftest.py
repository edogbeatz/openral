"""Repo-root pytest conftest — runs for every pytest invocation under this repo.

Discovered by pytest because ``pyproject.toml`` lives in this directory, so
this conftest is loaded for both the standard ``pytest tests/...`` runs and
for the ``pytest --doctest-modules python/...`` subprocess that
:mod:`tests.unit.test_doctest_runner` spawns.

Responsibilities
----------------
- **Silence structlog logging during tests.**  Several public modules emit
  ``log.info(...)`` from constructors / ``connect()`` / ``disconnect()``
  (e.g. :class:`openral_world_state.WorldStateAggregator`,
  :class:`openral_hal.RosControlHAL`,
  :class:`openral_hal.SO100FollowerHAL`).  structlog's default
  ``PrintLoggerFactory`` writes those records to *stdout*, which breaks
  doctest matching for any docstring example that constructs one of these
  objects.  Production deployments configure structlog with an OTel handler
  per CLAUDE.md §5.1; tests deserve the same explicit configuration so that
  test stdout reflects only the test's own assertions.

This conftest is intentionally narrow — Rich console neutering still lives
in ``tests/conftest.py`` because it only matters when running tests under
``tests/``.

# ── ROS 2 `launch` swaps the global logger class ──────────────────────────
# Importing `launch` runs `launch.logging.reset()` at module scope, which calls
# `logging.setLoggerClass(LaunchLogger)` — process-wide and permanent. Every
# logger created after that point, in any package, is a `LaunchLogger` whose
# `__init__` sets `self.propagate = False`.
#
# In production that is harmless: `launch` lives in the launcher process and
# the nodes it spawns are separate processes that never import it. In a test
# session it is not, because one `importorskip("launch.actions")` silently
# changes how every later test's loggers behave. It broke
# `test_sim_attached_hal.py::test_task_success_logger_reaches_the_openral_otel_bridge_namespace`,
# which asserts that `openral.sim.task_success` records reach the `openral`
# logger the OTel bridge is attached to — true in isolation, false after any
# test in the same worker had imported `launch`, and invisible in CI's ordering
# for a long while.
#
# Restoring the class is not enough on its own: loggers *already* built inside
# the polluted window keep `propagate = False` forever, so the `openral`
# namespace is repaired too. `openral.otel_bridge` is deliberately left alone —
# `install_structlog_bridge` sets `propagate = False` there on purpose, to stop
# double-emission through the root logger.
