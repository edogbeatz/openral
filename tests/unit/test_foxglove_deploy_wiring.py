"""What `--foxglove` has to put on the graph for the panels to fill.

Two things were missing on the real OpenArm cell, both invisible from inside the
graph — every node healthy, every panel empty:

* **The Bucket-2 converter was never spawned.** The layout's collision and voxel
  panels read `/openral/world_collisions_markers` and
  `/openral/world_voxels_cloud`, which are `visualization_msgs` / `sensor_msgs`
  re-publications of the custom `openral_msgs` world types. Foxglove renders the
  standard types natively and the custom ones not at all, and nothing else in
  the graph produces them, so those panels could never fill on any deploy.

* **Camera slots were a guess.** They are sensor names from the robot manifest
  and the deploy scene, and they differ per robot. A declared RGB sensor only
  gets a reader — and therefore a topic — when it carries a `deploy_binding`;
  `robots/openarm` declares a `top` camera for sim with none, so on the real
  cell `/openral/cameras/top/image` has zero publishers and its panel reads
  "Image topic does not exist", which is indistinguishable from a dead camera.
