"""Pin the mobile-base predicate that keeps ``/tf`` a single connected tree.

``SimSensorBridge`` publishes a static ``world -> base_frame`` root for a
fixed-base sim arm (a robosuite-attached LIBERO franka roots its tree at
``panda_link0`` with no parent, at a non-origin mount pose), and must skip it
for a mobile robot, whose ``MobileBaseBridge`` already publishes a live
``odom -> base_link``. Two parents for one frame splits ``/tf``:
``map -> base_link`` stops resolving and Nav2's global costmap times out.

Both the guard and the ``odom`` publisher call ``describes_mobile_base``
to agree on "mobile". Validated against real ``robots/*/robot.yaml``
manifests — no mocks (CLAUDE.md §1.11).

Pure-predicate half, no ROS needed. The bridge half (real ``SimSensorBridge``
+ real ``rclpy`` node) is ``tests/integration/test_sim_sensor_bridge_tf_guard.py``,
gated on ``OPENRAL_TEST_ROS_LIVE=1`` and listed in ``scripts/ros_live_tests.sh``
— previously behind an ``importorskip`` here, so it ran on no CI lane at all.
