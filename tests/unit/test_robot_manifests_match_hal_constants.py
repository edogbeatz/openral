"""Regression test — every ``robots/<id>/robot.yaml`` matches its ``*_DESCRIPTION`` HAL constant.

HAL constants in ``python/hal/src/openral_hal/`` are the runtime source of
truth; YAMLs under ``robots/`` are what the eval layer loads via
``ROBOTS.register``. Pins them together so a joint-limit/payload/safety-
envelope bump can't silently drift the YAML out of sync (issues #54-58).

UR5e/UR10e/Franka/Sawyer/ALOHA pin to their ``*_REAL_DESCRIPTION`` (production
manifests), derived from the sim baseline via
``openral_hal._real_description.make_real_description`` — kinematics,
safety envelope, capabilities and ``hal`` entrypoints are shared; only
``sdk_kind`` differs. G1/H1/Rizon4/OpenArm/Anvil-v2 pin to their sim baseline
because none has a real-HW HAL yet (G1/H1/Go2 gated on the M2 C++ S0 cerebellum,
CLAUDE.md §6.2; Rizon4/OpenArm/Anvil real-HW wrappers are tracked follow-ups)
— their ``hal.real`` is null until the real adapter lands.

SO-100 and ``pusht_2d`` are out of scope: SO-100's YAML carries optional
sensor entries the in-code constant omits; ALOHA's YAML carries a camera
``SensorSpec`` + observation/action spec the constant omits (only joint
inventory + capability + safety + sdk pointer are asserted equal for it);
``pusht_2d`` has no in-code DESCRIPTION sibling.
