"""Canary test: every in-tree rSkill manifest declares the new V1 fields.

Closes the "forgotten manifest" failure mode for the rSkill self-containment
audit (Gap 1, Gap 2, Gap 3). For every ``rskills/*/rskill.yaml`` discovered
by ``openral_rskill.loader.discover_intree_rskills`` the test asserts:

- Every entry in ``actuators_required`` carries a ``control_mode_semantics``
  block (Gap 2).
- The manifest declares a ``processors`` block UNLESS it is one of the two
  explicit legacy ACT-ALOHA skills whose upstream checkpoints carry norm
  stats inside ``model.safetensors`` and which the ACT adapter dispatches
  to a different code path.

No mocks, no synthetic fixtures — exercises the real `discover_intree_rskills`
helper and the real manifests on disk (CLAUDE.md §1.11, §5.4).
