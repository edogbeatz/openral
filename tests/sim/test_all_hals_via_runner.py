"""Cross-HAL integration test: drive every HAL twin through ``DeployRunner``.

This is the strongest "all wiring is correct" signal in the repo.  Each
per-HAL ``tests/sim/test_<robot>_hal_mujoco.py`` validates one HAL in
isolation; this suite parametrizes the **production**
``openral_runner.DeployRunner`` over every HAL twin and runs a
real rate-limited inference loop end-to-end:

    activate → for max_ticks:
        sensors → HAL.read_state → aggregator.snapshot →
        skill.step → safety.check_action → HAL.send_action
    → deactivate

If a HAL's joint indexing, units, lifecycle, or schema doesn't line up
with the rest of the stack (``WorldStateAggregator``, ``rSkillBase``,
``SafetyClient``, ``DeployRunner``), this suite catches it.  Every
per-robot sim test could pass while this one still fails — the
integration boundary is the new contract being exercised here.

No mocks (CLAUDE.md §1.11).  Real ``MujocoArmHAL`` / ``AlohaMujocoHAL``
subclasses, real ``WorldStateAggregator``, real ``DeployRunner`` with
``NullSafetyClient`` (the same default the production CLI uses for
twins).  The skill is a tiny ``EchoCurrentPoseSkill`` that returns the
robot's current joint state as a 1-step JOINT_POSITION action chunk —
that's always a valid, safety-envelope-clean command for any
embodiment, regardless of joint count, units, or asymmetric
conventions.
