"""WorldStateAggregator — tf2-aware, injectable snapshot producer.

Collects joint state, sensor image refs, EE poses, base pose, and battery
level from injected update callables and produces a ``WorldState`` Pydantic
snapshot on demand.

Diagnostics: each tracked component (joint state, sensor bundle, EE) gets a
``WorldState.diagnostics`` entry — ``"ok"`` (updated within
``staleness_limit_s``), ``"stale"`` (not), or ``"error"`` (latched via
``set_error``). Staleness is **latched**: once stale, a component stays
``"stale"`` until a fresh update arrives, so the Reasoner sees it across
snapshot boundaries.

Hot path: ``snapshot`` is the only hot-path method — it locks, samples
all injected state, classifies staleness, and returns an immutable model.
Update methods are called from ROS 2 subscriber callbacks.

Example:
    >>> import time
    >>> from openral_core import (
    ...     RobotDescription,
    ...     EmbodimentKind,
    ...     JointSpec,
    ...     JointType,
    ...     RobotCapabilities,
    ...     SafetyEnvelope,
    ...     ControlMode,
    ... )
    >>> from openral_core.schemas import JointState
