"""Built-in VLA / policy adapters for sim eval — registered at import time.

Mirrors ``openral_sim.backends`` but for the policy half of the
``(robot × scene × task × VLA)`` quad. To add a new policy, drop a module
here and register a factory in ``openral_sim.POLICIES``.

The factories themselves are responsible for lazily importing heavy backends
(torch, lerobot, openpi-client, …) so installing ``openral-sim`` never
pulls those transitively.
