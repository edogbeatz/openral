"""Policy-family dependency probing — shared by reasoner + skill_runner.

The policy factories in ``openral_sim.policies`` live behind opt-in extras
groups (``sim`` / ``libero`` / ``metaworld`` / ``robocasa``): ``transformers``,
``bitsandbytes``, ``lerobot[…]``, etc. When the right group isn't installed
the factory raises ``ImportError`` deep inside lerobot — confusing to surface,
and it leaves partially-loaded modules in ``sys.modules`` so subsequent calls
fail with a *different* ``cannot import name 'X'`` cascade error.

Two contracts live here:

* ``model_family_install_hint`` — the actionable uv-sync command for each
  known family, used by ``openral_rskill_ros.rskill_runner_node`` when
  translating a factory ``ImportError`` into ``ROSRuntimeError``.
* ``can_import_policy_family`` / ``filter_importable_manifests`` — pre-flight
  probes the reasoner runs at ``on_configure`` to drop rSkills whose deps
  aren't installed before the palette is built, so the operator sees one
  warning at boot ("dropped X: missing transformers; run ``just sync
  --all-packages --group sim``") instead of a per-tick dispatch failure.

Install commands always use ``just sync --all-packages --group <X>``, never
bare ``uv sync --group <X>``: ``--all-packages`` keeps the workspace members
(openral-core, openral-cli, …) installed — plain ``uv sync`` would uninstall
them and the next ROS launch would fail with ``No module named
'openral_core'``. ``just sync`` also repairs the ``hf-libero==0.1.3``
distutils-uninstall trap before+after the sync.

The probe never instantiates a factory or loads weights: by default it only
resolves the *top-level* package of each required import via
``importlib.util.find_spec`` (~0 ms, the same idiom
``openral_cli.deploy_sim._omdet_runtime_available`` uses). It deliberately
skips the deep module — ``lerobot/policies/__init__.py`` eagerly imports
every policy family's config class, so touching ``lerobot.policies.<anything>``
costs the whole tree (measured 6.6 s, and identically so via ``find_spec``,
which must import the parent to find the child). That cost was being paid in
three processes per deploy (CLI preflight, reasoner palette seed,
``runtime_node``) when only ``runtime_node`` needs the modules resolved.

The fast probe catches a dependency group that was never installed; it
cannot catch one that's installed but *broken* (a half-written editable
``.pth``, say) — that still surfaces at dispatch via
``rskill_runner_node``'s ``ROSRuntimeError``. Set
``OPENRAL_STRICT_POLICY_PROBE=1`` to restore the deep import probe when that
distinction matters.

Adding a new policy family: register it in both
``_FAMILY_REQUIRED_IMPORTS`` and ``_FAMILY_INSTALL_HINTS`` —
``test_reasoner_palette_filters_unimportable_families`` and
``test_known_model_families_get_concrete_install_hints`` walk both dicts, so
a half-registered family fails at unit-test time.
