# python/hal/src/openral_hal/sim_sensor_bridge.py
"""Shared sim-sensor + viewer bridge for scene-attached HAL lifecycle nodes.

Republishes whatever a ``SimAttachedHAL`` exposes — RGB camera frames
(``read_images``) on ``/openral/cameras/<n>/image`` and an optional live
``mujoco.viewer`` — for any manifest-driven node, so franka/ur5e/... reach
deploy-sim scene+camera+viewer parity without per-package wiring. Phase 2
adds ``/scan`` + depth ``PointCloud2``. rclpy is imported lazily so the
module stays import-safe in pure-Python CI.

It also owns the E-stop ground-truth record: one
``sim.estop_ground_truth_snapshot`` line per kernel stop — MuJoCo contacts,
near-miss distances, joint state, base TF, and the candidate chunk the
kernel was checking — so a stop can be adjudicated real-vs-false after the
fact. Diagnostics only: nothing on that path gates, delays, or alters
actuation.

    """Closest signed geom distances across the ``side`` boundary.

    The safety kernel stops on a *margin*, so a genuine stop usually leaves
    NO MuJoCo contact at the measured configuration — ``ncon`` alone cannot
    say whether a predicted ``-15 mm`` hit was real (contype/conaffinity
    exclusions can suppress a contact even at 30 mm of interpenetration).
    This measures signed distance (negative = interpenetration) for every
    ``side``↔other geom pair whose bounding spheres are within
    ``distmax_m``, ranked closest-first, truncated to ``max_pairs``.

    **The measurement is `convex_geom_distance`, not `mujoco.mj_geomDistance`
    — that call returns confidently wrong numbers on exactly the pair class
    this probe exists to adjudicate.** Measured on ``robocasa_fridge_drawer``
    layout 9, ``robot0_link7_collision`` vs
    ``fridge_right_group_freezer_door_main``: the default native-CCD path
    returned ``+0.000000`` via a 126.264 mm witness segment lying outside
    *both* geoms; libccd returned ``-57 mm`` / ``-352 mm`` through a 48 mm
    panel; certified truth is ``+0.148512 mm``. This is a degenerate
    configuration, not a distance regime — displacing the link a picometre
    gives the right answer — so no probe window avoids it, and a scene's
    reset pose is exactly where such configurations live. Every number this
    probe emits carries ``distance_certified``; the coverage block counts
    both certified and uncertified so a downstream adjudicator can refuse
    rather than believe
    (``tools/validation_matrix.py::probe_is_distance_certified``).

    The other side is either an explicit body set (``other_included`` — used
    for payload↔robot-link self-pairs, which are not "everything else") or,
    by default, every body outside ``side`` and ``other_excluded``.

    **Every side is restricted to solid geoms** — a geom with neither
    ``contype`` nor ``conaffinity`` cannot collide with anything and the
    kernel never checks it, so measuring against it manufactures
    meaningless penetrations. That rule used to apply only to the
    enumerated world side, which is how a purely visual mesh once carried
    a stop: the 2026-08-23 fridge round reported ``robot0_g42_vis ~
    fridge_main_group_g43`` at 0.000 m and was adjudicated
    ``real-contact``, while the nearest *solid* pair on the same link
    (``robot0_link7_collision``) was 2.5 mm clear. Both exclusion counts
    are reported (``noncollidable_side_geoms_excluded``,
    ``noncollidable_other_geoms_excluded``) so the omission is visible,
    and their presence is what lets a downstream adjudicator trust a 0 m
    pair at all. Applies to both sides — a body carries visual geoms
    alongside its collision ones, so scoping a side by body does not
    scope it to solid geometry.

    Bounded by construction: a vectorised distance-lower-bound prefilter
    (``_pair_distance_lower_bound``) reduces the O(n·m) pair set, then at
    most ``max_calls`` exact distance calls run, shared fairly across side
    geoms by ``_round_robin_candidates`` so no link is starved out of the
    report. Each call gets a **certified** window rejection first — a
    separating-axis bound that *proves* the pair is outside ``distmax_m``
    — which keeps the exact instrument affordable without weakening
    anything: a rejected pair was provably out of range, never
    heuristically dropped. Pure MuJoCo reads, no ROS.

    The prefilter is what a scene's floors used to defeat: MuJoCo reports
    ``geom_rbound == 0`` for geoms with no bounding sphere (planes,
    heightfields), and reading that as radius ``inf`` scored every such
    pair at ``-inf``, ahead of every finite pair. A plane is now bounded
    exactly (``|n · (c - p)| - r``), so a floor competes on real distance
    instead of pre-empting the queue. Round-robin bounds the residual: a
    heightfield still has no cheap bound and keeps ``-inf``, but it can
    cost each side geom only its first call, never the whole budget.

    Returns:
        ``(records, coverage)`` — ``records`` is the closest ``max_pairs``
        pairs; ``coverage`` reports how much of the candidate set the budget
        actually reached, so a *silent* omission can never be read as "nothing
        was near".

    The payload-side half of the adjudication budget, missing from the

    robot link is an OBB — the other side is a voxel cube, covered by
    ``collision_model_mesh_slop`` plus the cell half-diagonal. An
    *attached-payload self-collision* stop has an OBB on **both** sides:
    the kernel checks the payload's published primitives against the link
    OBBs (``check_attached_self_collision``), while the ground-truth probe
    still measures mesh against mesh — charging only the link's corner
    slop under-counts the admissible gap by the payload's own.

    Not hypothetical: in the 2026-08-22 ``baguette`` round the kernel
    stopped on ``attached:sim:obj_main`` vs ``panda_link2`` at -4.63 mm
    while the probe put the nearest payload mesh 75.86 mm from the same
    link. The kernel's own arithmetic at that configuration puts the pair
    at +21.71 mm — a 54.15 mm representation gap, of which
    ``panda_link2``'s 48.22 mm corner slop is only the robot's share.

    Payload primitives come from ``extract_body_primitives``, which lowers
    a *mesh* geom to its local AABB (clustering geoms past
    ``max_primitives``); a sphere/box geom lowers exactly and contributes
    nothing. This calls that producer directly and measures what it
    actually publishes, so the budget cannot drift from the geometry the
    kernel was handed.

    Args:
        model: live ``mujoco.MjModel``.
        data: live ``mujoco.MjData`` — a payload subtree can articulate, so
            the primitives and the sampled points are both taken live.
        attached_body_ids: root body ids of the currently carried payloads.
        max_primitives: the producer's per-object primitive cap, mirrored
            here so the measurement matches the published decomposition.

    Returns:
        ``{"objects": {<body>: {...}}, "max_corner_slop_m": float,
        "unresolved_objects": [...], "method": str}``, or ``{}`` when nothing

        zero. Each object entry carries ``n_primitives``,
        ``n_box_primitives`` (the subset that can be loose at all),
        ``corner_slop_m`` and ``collision_points_sampled``.

    ``_voxel_cube_hits`` walks a ray past a non-collidable strike and casts
    again, which finds a solid slab *behind* a decoration shell. It cannot find
    one **coincident** with it. RoboCasa builds every counter top that way:
    ``robocasa/models/fixtures/counter.py`` emits one full-span
    ``<name>_top_visual`` (``contype=0``) and then tiles the *same* volume with
    collidable chunks via ``_get_chunks``. Their surfaces are the same plane, so
    stepping ``distance + eps`` past the visual's face lands *inside* the chunk,
    where the ray reports no further entry surface and the chunk is never seen.

    Measured on ``2026-09-07-adr0101-live-1``: 9 of 27 rays struck
    ``counter_1_right_group_top_visual`` and nothing else, so the cell read
    ``noncollidable_world`` — while the certified probe put the collidable chunk
    ``counter_1_right_group_top_0``'s surface at ``z = 0.920`` and the cell
    spanned ``z in [0.900, 0.925]``. The solid geometry was inside the cell the
    whole time.

    This is a **conservative supplement**, not a replacement: an AABB overlap can
    claim a geom whose actual surface misses the cube, so it may report backing
    that a surface test would not. For a diagnostic whose failure mode is
    calling real geometry "decoration" (#180), erring toward *found* is the
    right direction — and it never removes a class the rays did find.

    """What MuJoCo geometry, if any, backs one occupancy voxel.

    The kernel stops on a cell in ``/openral/world_voxels``; the near-miss
    probes measure MuJoCo against MuJoCo and never look at the map, so a
    stop could be adjudicated "nothing was there" when map and world
    disagree. That gap hides in the probe's two blind spots — it excludes
    every robot body from the world side, and every non-collidable geom —
    so this locates the cell and asks MuJoCo directly, with no exclusions:

    * ``solid_world`` — a collidable world geom passes through the cell;
      the stop is explained by real geometry.
    * ``attached_payload`` — the carried object; should have been cleared
      from world occupancy by the bridge.
    * ``self_occupancy_suspect`` — the robot's own body, base and mount
      included. "suspect" because a robot body in the cell *now* is
      equally the signature of a correct stop on a link that reached real
      geometry — it cannot tell "the robot wrote this cell" from "the
      robot has since moved into it" (2026-08-23 fridge reconstruction:
      backing body ``robot0_link7``, the stopping link, 1.9 mm inside a
      freezer door). Read as a prompt to check the near-miss pairs, never
      as a finding alone.
    * ``noncollidable_world`` — a marker/visual geom. Since #180 these are
      transparent to the depth cast (no longer occupancy in sim), so a
      cell backed only by decoration is now a probe/stale-cell signal, not
      a live map defect; the ray is re-cast past it (``_voxel_cube_hits``)
      so any slab behind wins as ``solid_world``. Still reported when
      genuinely all there is.
    * ``unbacked`` — nothing at all: a phantom or stale cell.

    Method: three orthogonal ray fans, one per base-frame cube axis, each
    ``rays_per_axis**2`` rays started just outside one face and accepted
    only where the strike lies inside the cube. A depth-derived occupancy
    cell is created by a *surface* return, so surface sampling is the
    matching test — a cell buried strictly inside a solid is not sought.
    ``rays_cast``/``rays_hit`` are reported so ``unbacked`` reads as
    "looked and found nothing", never "did not look".

    Args:
        model: live ``mujoco.MjModel``.
        data: live ``mujoco.MjData`` at the stop instant.
        voxel_index: the kernel's world-obstacle index — the integer in a
            ``safety.collision`` line's ``b=voxel_<n>``. Row-major with x
            fastest, matching ``OccupancyVoxels``.
        grid_origin: base-frame position of voxel ``(0,0,0)``'s minimum corner.
        grid_resolution: cell size in metres.
        grid_size: ``(size_x, size_y, size_z)``.
        robot_body_ids: the robot's own MJCF bodies (the depth self-filter
            set), which is what makes ``self_occupancy_suspect`` cover the base
            and mount the world-side probe excludes.
        attached_body_ids: currently carried payload bodies.
        base_frame_body: MJCF body the grid frame denotes. ``None`` treats the
            grid as already world-aligned (synthetic/world-frame grids).
        grid_orientation_xyzw: the grid's own rotation, ``OccupancyVoxels
            .orientation``. The published lattice is the OctoMap's, so its axes
            are not ``base_frame``'s and this is what places a cell: a cell is
            ``grid_origin + R * ((index + 0.5) * resolution)``, and the cube's
            ray fans are cast along ``base_rot @ R``. Defaults to identity for
            a caller building an axis-aligned grid itself; the all-zero value
            an unset field carries is refused (``verdict`` ``"out_of_range"``),
            never read as identity — a confident verdict about the wrong cube
            is worse than none.
        rays_per_axis: rays per side of each face fan.

    Returns:
        A JSON-safe dict with ``voxel_index``, ``voxel_ijk``, ``base_xyz``,
        ``world_xyz``, ``resolution_m``, ``half_diagonal_m``, ``verdict``,

        ``rays_hit`` and ``method``. ``verdict`` is ``"out_of_range"`` when the

    is only right while the two are the same message — and they are not, as
    soon as the base drifts across one lattice boundary: the published window
    is snapped to the octree's cell boundaries (``build_lattice``), so a drift
    that crosses one shifts the whole window by a cell and every index in the
    newer grid names the cell one over. One cell is the whole grid resolution.

    Picks by stamp, never by arrival: the grid current at ``stamp_ns`` is the
    newest one stamped at or before it. ``None`` when nothing in ``history``
    is old enough — the caller then has no grid it can honestly decode against

    The published lattice is the source map's, fixed in map/odom, so a cell's
    WORLD centre is stable across messages even as the base-frame ``origin``
    slides with the robot. Quantising that centre by the resolution therefore
    gives a key that names the same physical cell in any later message, which
    is what lets a stop ask whether its cell predates an event.

    Keys are ``floor(centre_world / resolution)`` — which cell of the world
    lattice the centre falls in, NOT the nearest lattice node. Rounding is the
    wrong operator and fails in the ordinary case: when the grid origin is a
    multiple of the resolution every cell centre sits exactly on a rounding
    boundary, so ``rint`` and ``round`` disagree on all of them and the same
    physical cell keys two ways. Under ``floor`` a centre sits half a cell from
    either edge, the furthest it can be from a boundary.

    The lattice need not align with multiples of the resolution for this to be
    a bijection — only to be consistent, which it is, because every message
    comes from the one map. ``preattach_verdict`` still compares over a
    one-cell neighbourhood, so a lattice that does drift shows up as an

            an identity assumption — same posture as ``voxel_backing_record``.

    sections always populate, which a PRE-GRASP arm↔world stop needs (the

    **Contact lists are not a penetration oracle.** MuJoCo

    never "nothing is interpenetrating" — the ``nearest_*_pairs`` probes

        attached_body_ids: currently carried payload body ids (empty when

            lets wheel↔floor pairs (0-2 mm, and deliberately unchecked by the
            kernel) crowd out the arm.
        base_frame_body: MJCF body that ``base_frame`` denotes on ``/tf``.
            The kernel's collision FK is base-relative, so its world pose is
            what maps a reconstructed configuration back into MuJoCo world
            coordinates.
        joint_state: the HAL's ``JointState`` at the stop
            (the same vector the kernel seeded ``q_meas`` from), or ``None``.
        description: the ``RobotDescription`` whose ``collision_geometry`` is
            the kernel's collision model. Supplying it turns on
            ``adjudication_budget`` (``collision_model_mesh_slop``) and
            widens the probe window to that budget.
        evidence_voxel: the world-voxel cell the kernel stopped on, as
            ``{"index": int, "origin": (x, y, z), "resolution": float,
            "size": (nx, ny, nz)}`` (optionally ``"frame_body"``). Supplying it
            turns on ``evidence_voxel_backing``
            (``voxel_backing_record``) — the only part of this record that
            looks at the MAP rather than at MuJoCo alone.
        distmax_m: near-miss probe window *floor*. The window actually used is
            ``max(distmax_m, admissible_gap_m)`` and is reported as
            ``adjudication_budget.probe_distmax_used_m``.
        max_pairs: cap on reported nearest pairs, per probe.
        max_calls: cap on exact distance solves per probe. The
            prefilter ranks candidates by proximity first and spends the
            budget round-robin across the probed geoms, so this truncates the
            far end of each probe, never the close one, and never at the cost
            of leaving a geom unprobed while the budget covers the geom count.

    Returns:

        ``adjudication_budget`` makes a kernel number and a probe number
        comparable: the kernel measures OBB-to-voxel, the probes measure
        mesh-to-mesh, and the admissible gap is
        ``corner_slop(link) + voxel_half_diagonal`` (the 2026-08-22 round
        subtracted the two directly with only the quantization term and
        called a conservative, correct ``panda_link1`` stop a false
        positive).

        ``evidence_voxel_backing`` is the map-side half — what MuJoCo has

    A stop with ``last_action_ns == 0`` differs categorically from the
    mid-task stop the ``sim.estop_ground_truth_snapshot`` line reads like:
    no action has reached ``SimAttachedHAL.send_action`` yet — the single
    choke point every real action passes, stamped *before* any early
    return — so the configuration the kernel refused is the one the
    **scene reset produced**, not one a policy drove into. The robot was
    **spawned** somewhere unsafe, not doing something unsafe, and no
    policy, chunk, or margin tweak can clear it. The remedy is a
    scene-config change (a different seed, or pinned ``layout_ids`` /
    ``style_ids`` in ``backend_options``), not a safety one.

    This is observability only (CLAUDE.md §1.4): the stop itself is
    correct and is neither suppressed, delayed, nor altered — an initial
    pose that interpenetrates the scene is exactly what the kernel exists
    to refuse. This only names it, so an operator reading a run's
    artifacts does not spend a round debugging a policy that never got to
    act.

    ``candidate_chunks_seen`` is reported but deliberately does **not**
    gate: a chunk the kernel *rejected* is a candidate that was never
    applied, and that stop is still at the initial configuration.

    Args:
        snapshot: The ``estop_ground_truth_snapshot`` record for this stop.
            Read for ``sim_time_s`` and the closest ``nearest_robot_world_pairs``
            entry; any missing key is simply omitted from the result.
        stop_seq: The bridge's monotonic stop counter, joining this line to the
            ``sim.estop_ground_truth_snapshot`` line for the same stop.
        last_action_ns: ``SimAttachedHAL.last_action_ns`` — ``0`` until the
            first ``send_action``.
        candidate_chunks_seen: How many chunks the kernel had been offered on
            ``/openral/candidate_action`` when the stop fired.

    Returns:
        A JSON-safe record, or ``None`` when at least one action has already
        been applied (an ordinary mid-task stop, already fully covered by
        ``sim.estop_ground_truth_snapshot``).

        arrived within this window (so an active skill always wins). Default
        2000 ms — it MUST exceed the slowest action cadence of an active skill,
        which for a VLA is the re-inference gap (SmolVLA ≈ 0.45 s/chunk; π0.5 /
        MolmoAct ≈ 1 s). The original 200 ms assumed a 30-200 Hz S1 stream and
        so RACED a 2 Hz VLA: it injected ~8 HOLD steps between policy actions,
        corrupting the trajectory and burning the episode horizon (~100 env
        steps consumed in ~12 policy actions → the VLA never finished a grasp).
        2 s sits comfortably above any VLA re-inference gap yet below the
        reasoner's ~5 s idle tick, so idle-stepping resumes (cameras stay live)
        within ~2 s once a skill stops. A truly idle scene (no action ever,
        ``last_action_ns == 0``) idle-steps immediately.

        ``on_step``: an optional zero-arg callback invoked after each

        the manifest (CLAUDE.md §1.4, explicit beats implicit).

        The matching ``camera_info`` publisher is created alongside so any
        manifest camera can serve a pinhole consumer (cuVSLAM rig build, nvblox
        mono-depth framing) — link-framed cameras get TF from
        ``robot_state_publisher``, optical-frame cameras from
        ``_publish_camera_optical_tfs``. Both are published per-frame
        (VOLATILE) so a late-joining subscriber never misses a latched-once
        message.

        sits at a non-origin world pose (LIBERO mounts the franka at world
        ``[-0.66, 0, 0.912]``, varying by suite). The benchmark feeds the policy
        the WORLD-frame EE pose (robosuite ``robot0_eef_pos``); without this
        transform the ``libero_eef8d`` task-space state layout could only read
        the base-relative EE pose (off by the mount — the policy would see the

        A FLOATING base (legged) is the third case: it declares no

        genuinely moves. Pinning it under a static ``world -> base`` makes a
        walking robot animate its legs while never translating on ``/tf``.
        Those get a static ``world -> odom`` identity instead — the world root
        every consumer looks up is preserved, and ``MobileBaseBridge`` supplies
        the live ``odom -> base`` beneath it. Identity is exact, not an

        Gate (the PRIMARY safety gate): the HAL exposes a callable ``idle_step``,
        defined ONLY on ``SimAttachedHAL``. A real
        HAL never defines it, so the timer is never created against real
        hardware. This is the real guarantee, not "zero is harmless" (a zero
        vector is a HOLD in sim but "drive to 0 rad" — violent — on a real
        absolute-position arm).

        No MuJoCo-handle gate (dropped in a later revision): idle-stepping
        is valid for any wrapped SimRollout, so a non-MuJoCo backend (Isaac Sim
        sidecar, ManiSkill3) keeps its cameras live when idle too. ``idle_step``
        itself returns ``False`` for a non-sim HAL, and the
        catch-once-and-disable guard below contains any per-tick fault.

        The timer runs at ``camera_rate_hz`` so step-then-publish stays matched
        (the existing camera timer republishes the freshened ``_last_obs``); no
        separate rate param is introduced. The single-threaded rclpy executor
        ensures the idle callback and ``_on_safe_action`` never run

        comparing ``(object_id, evidence_ref)`` against the currently masked

        The previous membership test was ``object_id`` *addition* only, which

        acknowledged — the goal aborted 8 s later on a place that had in fact
        succeeded. A partial detach (2 payloads → 1) had the same shape.

        A revision that masks nothing new — an attestation-only re-publish, a
        partial detach — changes no perception geometry, so there is nothing to
        settle and the barrier releases immediately. The release is still
