"""Thread-safe plain-data proprio snapshot.

Decouples the HAL's control-critical publishers (``odom`` / ``joint_state``)
from its *sim* callback group so they publish at their configured rate without
head-of-line blocking behind ``env.step`` / camera render / scan-raycast on the
HAL's multi-threaded executor.

Contract:

* A ``ProprioFrame`` is **captured only from the sim callback group** —
  right after an ``env.step`` — where reading the HAL's proprio is safe (no
  concurrent step). Capture builds *plain data* (lists / tuples / a frozen
  ``JointState``); it never hands the simulator's
  live state to another thread.
* The frame is **stored and read** through this holder. The lock guards only
  the single reference swap / read — never an ``env.step`` / render / raycast —
  so a reader on the control thread is never blocked by the expensive sim work
  and always observes a *complete* frame (immutable, swapped atomically), never
  a torn one.

The holder is deliberately HAL-agnostic: it stores whatever the sim group
captured. The HAL-reading lives in the lifecycle node (the sim group), which is
where the "only the sim group touches the simulator" invariant is enforced.

    Plain, immutable data only (no live simulator handles), so it is safe to

    Attributes:
        state: Joint state (a frozen-ish Pydantic model of plain lists).
        base_pose: Planar base pose ``(x, y, yaw)`` — what Nav2 / SLAM consume.
        base_pose_6dof: Full base pose ``((x, y, z), (qx, qy, qz, qw))`` or
            ``None`` when the HAL does not expose it (fixed-base arms).
        base_twist: Base body twist ``(vx, vy, vz, wx, wy, wz)`` (REP-105 child
            frame), the latched commanded velocity Nav2's controller reads back.
        sim_time_ns: Cross-reset-monotonic elapsed simulation time in ns at this
            step (`SimAttachedHAL.sim_time_ns`), or ``None`` for a
            clock-less / wall-clock HAL. Captured here so the publisher
            thread can emit ``/clock`` without touching the simulator.
        policy_state: Optional simulator-native checkpoint state vector.
        qpos: Full MuJoCo ``MjData.qpos`` copied as plain floats, or ``None``
            when the HAL has no ``mujoco_handles`` (real hardware). A laptop
            kinematic viewer consumes this instead of HAL camera pixels.

    is swapped under the lock, a reader never sees a partially-updated frame.
