"""SimAttachedHAL — wrap any ``openral_sim.SimRollout`` as a HAL adapter.

Generic bridge between ``openral_sim.SimRollout`` and the
``openral_hal.HAL`` Protocol the ROS lifecycle nodes consume. Runs the
HAL and the env in one process — a split HAL/env process pair left ``/scan``
unable to ray-cast live MJCF geometry (no handle to ``MjModel``/``MjData``) —
so the lifecycle node's ``mujoco_handle_provider`` can bind to
``self._hal.mujoco_handles()``.

``read_state`` walks ``description.joints``, resolving each via
``JointSpec.sim_joint_name`` (or a matching env name) against the MJCF;
``send_action`` calls ``env.step(...)`` through a per-robot
``ActionPacker`` (see ``pack_action_for_env``), so the HAL is
generic across any robot whose manifest declares the joint mapping.

Also owns the **task-success signal**: ``deploy sim`` suppresses the
backend's own per-step task evaluation, so ``task_success`` reads the
backend's predicate and ``_observe_task_success`` logs
``sim.task_success`` on every change plus a terminal
``sim.task_success_final`` at ``disconnect`` — reached on a
signal-driven teardown via
``openral_hal.lifecycle.HALLifecycleNodeBase.shutdown_hal`` (SIGINT runs
no lifecycle transition). Observability only (CLAUDE.md §1.4): never
termination, reset, reward, or the action path.

CLAUDE.md §1.5/§3: ``read_state``/``send_action`` must fit the robot's
control cycle — ``env.step`` is the slowest call (robocasa ~5-15 ms on the
reference host, within the 50 ms/20 Hz Nav2 cmd_vel budget). This is a HAL
adapter, not a safety shim: every action here has already been clamped by
the C++ kernel.

        env only steps on ``/openral/safe_action`` receipt, so an idle scene
        freezes physics and cameras go stale.

        Safety: defined ONLY on ``SimAttachedHAL`` — real HALs don't

        gates its idle timer on ``callable(getattr(hal, "idle_step", None))``,

        would command "drive every joint to 0 rad" on a real absolute-position
        arm. Does not touch ``_last_env_action`` / ``_last_body_twist`` — an
        idle HOLD is orthogonal to the last skill command.

        Caveat: zero is a true HOLD only for velocity/OSC-delta/composite
        controllers. A position-controlled native backend (``so101_box``)
        drives joints toward 0 rad instead of holding — acceptable here since
        the goal is to keep the scene rendering, not freeze the arm. A backend
        can opt out via ``idle_action()`` returning its own hold vector (the
        BEHAVIOR-1K backend returns current joint targets).

        ``_env_action_dim`` is resolved by ``_probe_env_action_dim`` from
        the backend's own ``action_dim``; a backend with no width and no
        override fails loudly at ``connect``, so the idle tick never builds a

                sim-time stride.

            ``True`` if the env was stepped, ``False`` if suppressed (not
            connected, estop latched, or action dim unresolved).
