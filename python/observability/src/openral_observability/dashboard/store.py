"""In-memory aggregator for the live dashboard.

``TelemetryStore`` is the single shared object the OTLP/HTTP
receiver writes into and the SSE / JSON endpoints read from. It is
thread-safe (an asyncio task feeds it from request handlers; the SSE
generator subscribes from another task) and bounded — every internal
container has a fixed cap so a long-running session cannot grow
unboundedly.

The store keeps a *latest-wins* view of the three signals the dashboard
foregrounds — ``rskill.execute`` / ``rskill.chunk_inference`` /
``safety.check`` — plus a small ring of events (e-stop, safety
violation, deadline missed, sensor stale, ...) and per-instrument
rolling samples for metrics.

Wire format: callers feed in already-decoded
``opentelemetry.proto.trace.v1.trace_pb2.ResourceSpans`` /
``opentelemetry.proto.metrics.v1.metrics_pb2.ResourceMetrics``
messages. The receiver in ``openral_observability.dashboard.receivers``
does the protobuf decode; the store never parses protobuf itself.
