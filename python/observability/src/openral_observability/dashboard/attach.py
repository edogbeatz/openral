"""Spawn a child ``openral dashboard`` and attach the current process to it.

Inverse of ``openral dashboard --inprocess <cmd>``: there, the *dashboard*
spawns the workload as a child with OTLP env pre-set. Here, the
*workload* spawns the dashboard as a child (e.g. ``openral sim run
--dashboard``) so a user can light up the live pane without juggling
two terminals.

The helper is intentionally tolerant: if the child fails to start or
``/healthz`` never comes up, the workload continues without OTel
attached — convenience must not gate the run.

    Behaviour:

    * ``enabled=False`` — yield ``False`` immediately, no child spawned.
    * ``enabled=True`` — delegate to ``spawn_dashboard``; if it
      yields a URL, re-run ``configure_observability`` so the
      current process re-binds onto the freshly-attached endpoint;
      otherwise yield ``False`` (workload continues unattached).
    * On exit (regardless of attach success / workload outcome): if we
      were attached, drain via ``shutdown_observability`` *before*
      the child SIGINT in ``spawn_dashboard``'s ``finally`` so the
      last span/metric batch lands instead of churning on
      ``Connection refused`` after the receiver is gone.

    Args:
        enabled: Whether the caller asked for ``--dashboard``.
        port: Port for the spawned dashboard.
        subcommand: Re-open the ``cli.command`` root span under this name
            once the exporters are bound. The one ``openral_cli.main:_root``
            opened is a no-op span: with ``--dashboard`` the endpoint only
            exists after the child is healthy, which is *after* the callback
            ran, so that span records nothing and every workload span below
            it becomes its own orphan root. Pass the subcommand to get a real
            root back — and with it ``RunResult.trace_id`` /
            ``RSkillEvalResult.trace_id``, which read the ambient trace.
            ``None`` keeps the orphan-root behaviour.
        mode: ``openral.run.mode`` for that span (``semconv.RUN_MODE_*``).

    Yields ``True`` iff a dashboard was actually attached.
