OpenRAL observability — OpenTelemetry tracing + structlog→OTLP logging bridge for Skill / inference / safety spans

Part of [**OpenRAL**](https://github.com/OpenRAL/openral) — the open Robot
Abstraction Layer for vision-language-action robotics. This package is one
member of the OpenRAL Python workspace; see the architecture overview and the
eight-layer model in the project docs.

## Connection freshness (host clock)

The dashboard header pill (`live` / `stale` / `dead`) is OTLP ingest age
on the **dashboard host**: `now_unix - last_ingest_ts` from the snapshot,
not "is the browser's EventSource up" and not `Date.now()`. A laptop
viewing a port-forwarded remote `:4318` is often ≥60 s off the VM, which
used to freeze the pill on `DEAD (1m)` while spans were still landing.
The same host-clock age drives every per-card status dot. See
[`docs/quickstart/dashboard.md`](../../docs/quickstart/dashboard.md).

## Voice prompt (local speech-to-text)

The live dashboard's operator-prompt box has a mic button. Click it and the
browser listens until you stop speaking — voice-activity detection runs
client-side via [`@ricky0123/vad-web`](https://github.com/ricky0123/vad)
(Silero VAD). The captured audio is POSTed to `POST /api/transcribe`, which
runs a **local** [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper)
model on the host, fills the prompt box with the transcript, and sends it via
the normal `/api/prompt` path. Your audio never leaves the machine.

`faster-whisper` ships with the `dashboard` extra (which `openral-cli` already
pulls in). The small browser glue files for VAD are vendored under
`static/vendor/vad/`; the large pinned Silero ONNX and onnxruntime WASM assets
are fetched and checksum-verified into `$OPENRAL_CACHE_DIR/dashboard_assets/vad/`
on dashboard startup, then copied into the served static directory. If those
assets are unavailable, `/api/config` reports `voice_prompt_enabled=false` and
the mic button stays disabled instead of failing at click time. The transcription
endpoint still degrades to HTTP 503 if `faster-whisper` is ever stripped from the
environment. Whisper model weights are fetched from the Hugging Face Hub on the
first transcription and then cached (pre-pull both caches to stay air-gapped).

Tuning knobs (read at first transcription; defaults run on any CPU):

| Env var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENRAL_STT_MODEL` | `base.en` | any faster-whisper model id (`tiny.en`, `small`, `large-v3`, …) |
| `OPENRAL_STT_DEVICE` | `cpu` | `cuda` to use a local GPU |
| `OPENRAL_STT_COMPUTE` | `int8` | CTranslate2 compute type (`int8`, `float16`, …) |

The vendored browser assets and their versions/licenses are documented in
[`static/vendor/vad/NOTICE.md`](src/openral_observability/dashboard/static/vendor/vad/NOTICE.md),
which also records the `npm pack` command to refresh them.

## Safety · current state (latched `/openral/safety_status`)

ADR-0096. Every other card on the dashboard is fed by OTel over the embedded
OTLP receiver. This one is not: `SafetyStatusSubscriber` opens a real rclpy
subscription to the **latched** `/openral/safety_status`
(`openral_msgs/SafetyStatus`, RELIABLE + TRANSIENT_LOCAL + KEEP_LAST=1) that
the C++ safety kernel and `SafetyPassthroughNode` both publish, and writes
each status into the store via `TelemetryStore.set_safety_status`.

Why a topic and not a span: the `safety.check` span path can only *infer* a
latch from chunk flow, and a latched kernel is exactly the state in which the
chunk flow stops. Durability closes the other half — a dashboard opened
mid-mission receives the current value on connect, instead of showing
"unknown" until the next fault.

The card renders `latched` / `clear` / `stale`, the typed `drop_reason`, the
publisher's `detail`, the `rskill` in flight, and the age of the last
transition. Publishers re-stamp at 1 Hz, so an age past ~3 s flips the card to
`stale`, meaning **unknown, not safe** — the publisher may be gone (hazard-log
HZ-0096-1). Without rclpy or the `openral_msgs` overlay the subscriber stays
inert and the card reads *waiting*; it never renders "clear" from an absence
of data. Read-only: it holds no publisher, no service client, and no
authority over the robot.

## Live camera video (MJPEG stream)

The camera cards in the dashboard now show live video instead of a static
thumbnail. Each camera is served at:

```
GET /api/camera/{source}/stream
```

This endpoint re-serves the per-camera OTLP thumbnail JPEG as a continuous
`multipart/x-mixed-replace` MJPEG stream — the same thumbnails that already
flow in via the `sensors.read_latest` span attribute `thumbnail_jpeg_b64`.
Sim HAL cameras emit those spans at the camera timer (capped 25 Hz); the
EventSource snapshot omits the JPEG so a 30 Hz telemetry tick does not
re-parse two base64 thumbs. No extra camera pipeline is needed. Go2 hero
slots `front` (main/snout) and `top` (side/3/4) are always known, so the
page mounts two labeled panels while WAITING and the stream waits for a
frame. A laptop dashboard with no local OTLP follows cricket's tunneled
dashboard (`http://127.0.0.1:14318/api/camera/{source}/stream`) so this
`:4318` page shows the same two pictures. 404 only for a name that is
not a hero slot and has never been ingested.

## Perception overlays on the camera tiles

The camera tiles show what the robot *sees*; the overlays show what it *made of
it*. `kind: detector` boxes and `kind: segmenter` masks are drawn on a canvas
layered over each tile's MJPEG frame, so a mis-grasp no longer has to be
diagnosed by reading a label list beside a picture.

**Detector boxes** stream today. `PerceptionOverlaySubscriber` opens a real
rclpy subscription to `/openral/perception/objects`
(`openral_msgs/PromptStamped`, BEST_EFFORT + VOLATILE + KEEP_LAST=5 — the
sensor-class profile `ros_image_detector_node` publishes with; a RELIABLE
subscriber would never match it) and decodes the `metadata_json` payload as an
`openral_core.ObjectsMetadata`, writing it to the store via
`TelemetryStore.set_perception_detections`. Each box renders as a coloured rect
with a `label 0.87` chip.

**Segmenter masks** are not a stream by nature. `openral_msgs/srv/SegmentInView`
is a *service*: it returns plural full-frame **mono8** `sensor_msgs/Image` masks
(255 = in mask), ordered area-ascending, with a parallel
`mask_scores_advisory`, one shot per attach/detach/regrasp event. So the
producer is a **diagnostic** re-publication of that reply, and it lives next to
the producer rather than as unreachable code here:
`openral_perception_ros.segmenter_node` publishes `openral_msgs/SegmentMasks`
on `/openral/perception/masks` when its `publish_debug_masks` parameter is set
(**default false** — off, no publisher exists at all). `PerceptionOverlaySubscriber`
subscribes it at the matching sensor-class QoS (BEST_EFFORT + VOLATILE +
KEEP_LAST=1) and decodes each mask with `mono8_mask_to_png_b64` (mono8 → an LA
PNG whose alpha *is* the mask, tintable in one canvas composite) into
`TelemetryStore.set_perception_masks`.

Nothing on the robot reads that topic: the HAL's attachment producer takes its
masks from its own service reply and gates them on geometry. Dropping every
message here changes only what an operator sees.

The advisory scores are displayed and **never** used to rank or filter. The
service documents why: a mis-aimed prompt was measured returning a
59.8%-of-frame mask at that model's *top* score of 0.977. Masks render in the
producer's area-ascending order.

Three properties worth knowing:

* **Coordinates are source-image pixels**, and the tile shows an
  aspect-preserving 480×360 thumbnail under `object-fit: cover`. The renderer
  maps through the cover transform using the overlay's own `frame_width` /
  `frame_height`, so boxes track the displayed size rather than sitting at a
  constant offset from what they describe.
* **`OPENRAL_DASHBOARD_FLIP_180` is honoured.** Detectors consume the raw
  camera topic while that env var rotates only the dashboard's display copy;
  the flag rides on each overlay so the renderer applies the same turn. Without
  it the boxes would land point-mirrored on a picture that looks right.
* **Stale overlays fade, then clear.** Freshness runs on the dashboard's own
  receipt clock (source stamps ride sim time in a sim deploy): an overlay dims
  after 1.5 s, is gone by 4 s, and is dropped immediately if the tile's frame
  is more than 2 s newer than it. The producing rSkill is named in the tile's
  bottom-right corner, so "whose boxes are these" is never a guess.

Instance colours are the one chroma the dashboard allows outside the
safety palette, and they live in `dashboard.js` (`OVERLAY_COLORS`) because they
are painted into a canvas, never onto UI chrome. Slots are assigned in fixed
order by a stable hash of the label, so a label keeps its colour across frames
instead of repainting when the detection count changes — and every mark is also
directly labelled, so identity is never colour-alone.

Without rclpy or the `openral_msgs` overlay the subscriber stays inert and the
tiles render exactly as they did before. Read-only and advisory: it decides
only what an operator *sees*, never what the robot does.

## mDNS discovery (`mdns` extra)

Install the optional `mdns` extra to let `openral dashboard` advertise itself
on the LAN and browse for other OpenRAL services:

```
pip install openral-observability[mdns]
# or, inside the OpenRAL workspace:
uv sync --group mdns
```

This pulls in [`zeroconf>=0.131`](https://github.com/python-zeroconf/python-zeroconf)
(LGPL-2.1, TSC-approved 2026-06-21; used unmodified as an optional declared
dependency, not vendored).

When `zeroconf` is importable, `run_dashboard` starts a `Discovery` instance
that:

- **Browses** for `_openral-otlp._tcp.local.` services on the LAN (always).
- **Advertises** the dashboard's own OTLP endpoint on the LAN — but **only
  when the bind address is a non-loopback, non-wildcard IPv4 address**. A
  loopback (`127.0.0.1`) or wildcard (`0.0.0.0`) bind is browse-only and never
  advertised (advertising a loopback address to the LAN is meaningless, and
  advertising a wildcard address is ambiguous).

Discovered services are surfaced in the "Add Robot" panel via a read-only
endpoint:

```
GET /api/robots
→ {"enabled": true, "robots": [{name, addresses, port, properties, last_seen}, …]}
```

When the `mdns` extra is absent or `zeroconf` fails to start, the endpoint
returns `{"enabled": false, "robots": []}` — the dashboard runs exactly as
before; discovery is additive, never load-bearing.

## Write-controls (`OPENRAL_DASHBOARD_WRITE_CONTROLS`)

> **Default: OFF.** These endpoints are pending safety-WG review and a
> hazard-log update. Do not enable in production until the safety WG
> has signed off.

Two guarded write endpoints are available when the flag is set:

```
POST /api/skill/execute   # dispatch an ExecuteRskill action goal (returns 202 on acceptance)
POST /api/param/set       # tune a non-safety ROS 2 parameter via ros2 param set
```

Plus the Go2 **demo** bar (same gate):

```
POST /api/demo/stand | recalibrate   # e-stop clear + ResetToPose (Go2+Z1 parks Z1 at arm-ready)
POST /api/demo/walk                  # apply rsl-rl velocity walk (when that skill is selected)
POST /api/demo/stop                  # cancel ExecuteRskill (no e-stop latch) + Hub stand
POST /api/demo/load                  # cold-reload Bare Go2 (auto-stand) / Go2+Z1 (Recalibrate next)
GET  /api/demo/cricket               # idle remaining; occupancy; does not reset the timer
POST /api/demo/cricket/touch         # dashboard interaction — reset idle
POST /api/demo/cricket/start         # laptop: brev start + tunnels + attach; already-running is success
POST /api/demo/cricket/end           # cancel skill, stop graph, stop Brev host (not E-STOP; not Stop)
```

`POST /api/skill/execute` returns **HTTP 202** as soon as the action server
accepts the goal — it does **not** block on skill completion. The response body
includes `goal_id` for telemetry correlation. Execution progress is tracked via
the dashboard SSE stream and OTLP telemetry. The acceptance timeout is
configurable via `OPENRAL_DASHBOARD_SKILL_ACCEPT_TIMEOUT_S` (default `12` s).

Enable them by starting the dashboard with the environment variable set:

```bash
OPENRAL_DASHBOARD_WRITE_CONTROLS=1 openral dashboard
```

The dashboard prints a loud `WARNING:` banner to stderr on startup when the
flag is on. The flag is also surfaced in `GET /api/config`:

```json
{"jaeger_ui_url": "...", "write_controls_enabled": true,
 "demo_controls_enabled": true, "demo_presets": [{"id":"go2","label":"Bare Go2",
 "resume":"stand","story":"bare"}, {"id":"go2_z1","label":"Go2 + Z1",
 "resume":"","story":"armed"}], "robot_embodiment_tags": ["go2_z1","go2",...],
 "walk_skill_ids": ["Acquire/rskill-rsl-rl-onnx-go2-velocity-flat",
 "OpenRAL/rskill-rsl_rl_onnx-go2-velocity_flat-fp32"],
 "cricket": {"instance":"abundant-turquoise-cricket","idle_timeout_s":900,
  "can_start_from_cold":true, "role":"laptop",
  "foxglove_url":"ws://127.0.0.1:8765",
  "cricket_dashboard_url":"http://127.0.0.1:14318/"}}
```

The page reads that flag to decide whether to render the stepped **demo**
wizard. Bare Go2 (`resume=stand`) auto-calibrates after reload and lands on
select skill + Apply; Go2+Z1 (`story=armed`) asks for Recalibrate first.
Neither auto-walks. The last selected skill id is remembered per robot. The
skill picker is fed by the read-only
`GET /api/skills`, which indexes
`rskills/*/rskill.yaml` via `openral_rskill.loader.discover_intree_rskills` and
reports each manifest's `name` — the id the skill_runner's in-tree resolver
looks up — so a pick always resolves. Apply on the walk skill uses
`POST /api/demo/walk` (`velocity_commands: [0.35, 0, 0]`); every other pick
POSTs `/api/skill/execute` with blank goal params (manifest defaults). **Stop**
cancels that goal via `/openral/execute_rskill/_action/cancel_goal` and snaps
Hub stand — it does not latch e-stop. **Start Cricket** / **End Cricket** sit
on the same bar: a laptop Start `brev start`s a stopped box, opens SSH
tunnels (Foxglove `:8765`, cricket dashboard `:14318`), and attaches the
graph (already-running is a success, not a relaunch); End cancels the skill
then stops the graph and `brev stop`s the host so GPU billing stops.
Idle auto-Ends after `OPENRAL_CRICKET_IDLE_S` (default 15 min) unless a skill
is running or the operator is using the page. The separate **Run skill** strip stays
hidden while the demo bar is shown. With the
flag off there is no bar, because the endpoints behind it answer 403. See
[`docs/quickstart/dashboard.md`](../../docs/quickstart/dashboard.md#running-a-skill-from-the-page).

**Safety posture:**

- Both endpoints return `403` when the flag is off (default).
- `POST /api/param/set` also refuses any param name that matches a substring in
  a hard-coded safety denylist (`velocity`, `accel`, `force`, `torque`,
  `limit`, `workspace`, `estop`, `e_stop`, `deadman`, `dead_man`, `safety`,
  `safe`, `watchdog`) — these must be changed via a reviewed config or manifest,
  never the dashboard (CLAUDE.md §1.1).
- Every attempt (permitted or denied) is audit-logged at WARNING level before
  any subprocess is spawned, providing a paper trail.
- The safety kernel (`cpp/openral_safety_kernel`) remains the sole authority on
  whether a skill action proceeds — the dashboard shells out to
  `ros2 action send_goal /openral/execute_rskill`; the kernel disposes.
