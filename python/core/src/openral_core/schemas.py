    Lets the generic HAL camera rig (``openral_hal._camera_rig``) splice a
    manifest camera into a bare-arm MJCF that ships no ``<camera>`` elements, so
    a ``deploy sim`` digital twin renders the robot's declared cameras without a
    per-robot scene composer. A camera is a property of the robot's sensor suite
    (the wrist camera is bolted to the gripper; the overhead camera is a declared
    sensor), so its sim pose lives on the ``SensorSpec``, not in a scene.

    The rig only splices a camera that is *absent* from the loaded MJCF, so this
    is a no-op for scene-attached or already-composed models (those carry their
    own cameras).

    Attributes:
        parent_body: MJCF body the camera is rigidly mounted to (tracks that
            body's pose — e.g. the gripper/``Fixed_Jaw`` for a wrist camera).
            ``None`` mounts it world-fixed in ``<worldbody>`` (an overhead /
            third-person camera).
        pos: Camera position ``(x, y, z)`` in metres, in ``parent_body``'s frame
            (or world when ``parent_body`` is ``None``).
        target: Look-at point ``(x, y, z)`` in the same frame; the camera's
            MuJoCo ``-z`` view axis is oriented from ``pos`` toward it.
        up: World-up hint used to level the camera roll. Defaults to ``(0, 0, 1)``.
            A camera physically mounted upside-down (e.g. a wrist phone bolted
            inverted on the gripper) uses ``(0, 0, -1)`` to roll the image 180°.
        fovy_deg: Vertical field of view in degrees. ``None`` derives it from the
            sensor's pinhole ``intrinsics`` (``2·atan(height / (2·fy))``) so the
            rendered FoV matches the declared camera model.

            on this channel — radians or metres for arm joints, and
            ``(0.0, 1.0)`` for a gripper whose HAL contract is a normalised
            jaw fraction (i.e. one declared ``normalised`` in
            ``SimDescription.grippers``). The safety kernel's envelope,
            the rSkill runner's pre-clamp and the supervisor's
            ``gripper_min`` / ``gripper_max`` all compare a **commanded
            Action value** against these bounds, so declaring a normalised
            gripper's mechanical radian range here stops the envelope from
            constraining that channel at all (issue #62). A mechanical range
            that differs from the channel unit belongs in
            ``SimGripperDescription.ctrl_range`` / the URDF.
        velocity_limit: Maximum velocity.
        effort_limit: Maximum effort (N or Nm).
        has_position_sensor: Whether position feedback is available.
        has_velocity_sensor: Whether velocity feedback is available.
        has_torque_sensor: Whether torque feedback is available.
        backlash_estimate: Estimated backlash in radians.
        actuator_kind: Type of actuator.
        sim_joint_name: Optional override carrying the **MJCF/MuJoCo
            joint name** as it appears in the simulator's compiled
            model when that name differs from ``name``. The HAL
            uses ``name`` for the world-state contract (it's the
            URDF-shaped logical identifier the safety supervisor sees
            on every chunk); a separate ``sim_joint_name`` lets a
            sim-adapter look up ``mj_name2id`` without hardcoding
            robosuite / robocasa / MuJoCo naming conventions in
            backend modules. ``None`` means "the MJCF joint name
            matches ``name``" — true for every fixed-base
            manipulator we ship; only mobile bases and humanoids
            whose MJCF auto-prefixes joints (robosuite's
            ``mobilebase0_…`` namespace, GR-1's ``robot0_…``) need
            it.
        role: Structural classification. The downstream
            runner / safety / dataset-bridge code identifies grippers
            and base DoFs by this tag instead of substring-matching the
            joint name (which silently misclassifies any joint
            containing ``"gripper"``, e.g. ``"gripper_pose"``). Default
            ``"unknown"`` keeps legacy manifests loadable; the fleet
            annotates incrementally as this rolls out.
        origin_xyz: Fixed translation (metres) of this joint's frame in
            its ``parent_link`` frame — the URDF ``<joint><origin xyz>``.
            With ``origin_rpy`` and ``axis_xyz`` it gives the
            kernel everything it needs for forward kinematics.
            Default ``(0, 0, 0)``; populated by the offline lowering tool
            (from MJCF/URDF) only for robots that enable self-collision
            checking — legacy manifests are unaffected.
        origin_rpy: Fixed orientation (roll, pitch, yaw, radians) of this
            joint's frame in its ``parent_link`` frame — the URDF
            ``<joint><origin rpy>``. Default ``(0, 0, 0)``.

class TightCollisionGeometry(BaseModel):
    """Tight convex geometry refining a link's ``BoxShape`` for the kernel's narrow phases.

    The safety kernel's arm-link-vs-world-voxel check runs a **staged** narrow
    phase when a link declares this: a 26-DOP separating-axis bound on every
    occupied cell, then GJK on the link's exact convex hull for the cells the
    DOP cannot clear. Self-collision does the same for a box pair the OBBs
    cannot separate, when *both* links declare a stage-2 hull — which retired
    the ``panda_link5``/``panda_link7`` allowed-collision exemption (issue
    #191). Both stages are strict subsets of the box they refine, so the
    broad-phase window (sized from ``half_extents_m`` alone) does not move.
    Expressed in the box's own local frame (``LinkCollisionGeometry.origin_xyz_rpy``).

    Containment is checked here, again by the kernel at ``on_configure``
    (``validate_tight_geometry``), and once more against the real source mesh
    by ``tests/unit/test_collision_tight_geometry.py`` — **definitional
    rather than fitted**: the slabs are tangent halfspaces ``u·x <= max over
    the mesh of u·x``, the hull is ``conv(vertices)`` of the mesh, no
    optimiser tolerance anywhere.

    Generated by ``tools/generate_tight_geometry.py``; not hand-authored.

    Attributes:
        dop_lo_m: Per-axis lower slab bound along ``DOP_AXES``, 13 entries.
        dop_hi_m: Per-axis upper slab bound, 13 entries.
        hull_vertices_m: Exact convex-hull vertices in the box frame, at most
            ``MAX_TIGHT_HULL_VERTICES`` of them. **Empty means stage 1
            only** — the DOP still tightens the check, but no exact test runs.
            That is the representation a link whose hull is over the ceiling
            gets, and it is a cost decision, not a safety one: the DOP is a
            containing solid either way.
        hull_overhang_m: How far the hull's surface reaches past the real
            source mesh it was built from, sampled by
            ``tools/generate_tight_geometry.py`` (issue #221). Containment
            (``mesh ⊆ hull``) is proved elsewhere; this is the *other*
            direction, and it is what an offline adjudicator needs to charge a
            hull-fidelity self-collision stop an admissible gap instead of
            leaving it unscorable. ``None`` when ``hull_vertices_m`` is empty,

    four. But a real robot's collision tree also contains rigid mounts (a

    and without them the tree is a *forest*.

    This list is that missing connectivity and nothing else: no limits, no

    the collision tree and **refuses to load a robot whose collision links

    ``robot_ip`` / ``fci_ip`` — so the manifest is the single source of those
    defaults instead of a per-robot lifecycle-node subclass. This is the
    schema seam that lets the unified, ``robot.yaml``-driven
    ``ManifestHALLifecycleNode`` serve a parameterised HAL without
    a bespoke ``_create_hal``.

    ``openral_hal.build_hal`` merges ``defaults`` **underneath** any
    explicit ``transport`` kwargs (so a ``deploy run`` override wins) and then
    drops every key the target HAL constructor does not accept — exactly the
    filtering it already applies to ``transport``. Empty by default, so robots
    that need no construction kwargs (the derived ``MujocoArmHAL`` arms) are
    unaffected.

    Attributes:
        defaults: HAL constructor / transport keyword defaults, e.g.
            ``{"port": "/dev/ttyACM0", "baud": 1_000_000}`` for the SO-100 or
            ``{"robot_ip": "192.168.1.10"}`` for a real UR arm.
        can_bus_bindings: Maps a key of ``defaults`` to the **role token**
            that identifies which physical CAN bus fills it, e.g.
            ``{"left_can_interface": "left", "right_can_interface": "right"}``.
            Declaring this opts the robot into having ``openral detect``
            overwrite those defaults with the interface names actually found
            on the host, instead of shipping one lab's names to every user.

            A CAN interface name is a property of the *host*, not of the
            robot: the same arm is ``openarm_left`` on a machine with a udev
            rule and ``can1`` on one without. The manifest therefore declares
            only which parameter each bus fills and how to recognise it; the
            value is discovered. Robots with no CAN bus leave this empty and
            are untouched.

            The token is matched case-insensitively as a substring of the
            interface name, so it works for any bus count — one entry for a
            single-bus arm, two for a bimanual station, N for an N-limb
            machine. Matching is never positional: alphabetical order is a
            coincidence, and binding the left arm's trajectory to the right
            arm's bus is exactly the failure this avoids. An entry that
            matches no interface, or more than one, is reported as a warning
            and leaves the manifest value untouched (CLAUDE.md §1.4).

    2026-08-15 — 37.5 mm at sim's 25 mm cells, 40 mm rather than 75 mm at a
    real 50 mm grid since the absolute ceiling still binds) so it can
    physically reach the support contact the place witness is *earned by*.
    Round-6 validation: without it the flagship counter->cabinet insertion
    cannot complete even with a correct declaration — passing through an
    enclosed target's opening means passing within margin distance of
    voxel-quantised walls, and at 25 mm cells that quantisation closes the
    opening's predicted clearance 22-30 mm before the payload arrives. A
    witness earned by touching can never arm if the payload is stopped
    before it can touch.

    **Producer-supplied, producer-specific.** Sim computes it from the
    declared body's MuJoCo model subtree; real hardware's perception seam is
    **not yet implemented**, so no allowance applies on real hardware today
    (the same posture real-hardware place-witness attestation is under). The
    kernel is producer-agnostic: it consumes this box identically whoever
    measured it, and never derives one itself.

    The box is **oriented**, not axis-aligned — the axis-aligned hull of a
    rotated receptacle is strictly larger, i.e. more permissive. Absent
    (``PlaceDeclaration.region is None``) means no allowance at all — the
    pre-amendment margins, unchanged. A degenerate or over-large region is
    rejected here and again in the kernel, both times toward "no allowance".

    Attributes:
        frame_id: Frame ``pose`` is expressed in. Must be the robot base
            frame — the frame ``OccupancyVoxels`` is published in. The kernel
            refuses a region whose frame does not match the occupancy grid's,
            because a region measured in one frame and applied in another is a
            relaxation aimed at the wrong volume.
        pose: Region box centre pose in ``frame_id``.
        half_extents: Box half-extents along its own axes (m), each in
            ``(0, MAX_HALF_EXTENT_M]``.
        evidence_ref: What the producer measured the box from, for
            attributability (HZ-0097-2/4). Free text, never parsed.
        stamp_ns: Producer timestamp.
        geometry: The declared target's own collision primitives, each posed in
            ``frame_id`` (ADR-0098, survey Path B). Empty — the default, and
            what every producer that cannot measure geometry publishes — leaves
            the region behaving exactly as it did before ADR-0098. Supplying it
            lets the kernel adjudicate a cell against the modelled surface
            instead of against the 25 mm cube that quantised it, bounded so that
            it can never be more permissive than the box alone: the kernel uses
            the modelled distance only while it is within the blanket allowance
            that cell would have been granted anyway.

        **Clock-domain contract.** ``now_ns`` and ``stamp_ns`` must be
        readings of the *same* clock, and that clock is the publishing graph's
        ROS clock: the dispatching rSkill runner stamps the declaration from
        ``node.get_clock().now()``, the evidence producer re-stamps its
        publications from the same clock, and the safety kernel compares against
        its own. Under ``use_sim_time`` that domain is **simulator** time, whose
        readings are small (order 1e9 ns) where wall time is order 1.79e18 ns.
        A consumer that has no such reading of its own must use the newest stamp
        observed on the message stream carrying the declaration — never
        ``time.time_ns``, which reports a wall epoch that puts every sim-stamped
        declaration ~57 years past its backstop and silently kills it.

        Args:
            now_ns: Consumer's current time, same clock as ``stamp_ns`` — see

class SupportContactWitness(BaseModel):
    """Bounded attestation that a payload rests on a named support surface.

    Attachment says what the robot is carrying; it does not say the payload
    is free of its environment (ADR-0092 D6). A grasped baguette still lies
    on the counter while the gripper closes, and the safety kernel correctly
    sees that as a payload-vs-world penetration. This witness is World
    State's statement that one specific contact is legitimate — the kernel
    exempts nothing else. Absent witness, absent exemption: the kernel stops.

    Geometry is expressed in the **attached object's own frame**,
    deliberately not the base frame and not voxel indices: indices
    decorrelate as a mobile base drives and the occupancy lattice re-phases
    underneath the robot, while the physical contact persists — the object
    frame moves with the payload, so the attested plane keeps naming the
    same physical support face.

    ``max_penetration_m`` is a **physical** depth. A 25 mm occupancy lattice
    reads a 1 mm physical contact as up to ~15 mm of penetration because the
    surface cell's cube overshoots the true surface; the kernel accounts for
    that discretisation separately and geometrically, so inflating this field
    to cover it would license real penetration.

    Attributes:
        support_id: Identity of the supporting environment surface.
        contact_point_in_object: A point on the support plane, object frame.
        contact_normal_in_object: Unit outward support normal in the object
            frame, pointing from the supporting solid toward the payload.
        patch_radius_m: Lateral radius of the supported patch about the contact
            point. Contact outside it is never exempt.
        max_penetration_m: Attested bound on the physical penetration depth.
        confidence: Witness confidence in ``[0, 1]``.
        evidence_kind: Source that measured the support contact. The MuJoCo
            producer attests ``SIM_GEOM_DISTANCE`` — a signed closest-distance
            probe, not the solver's contact list, which ``contype`` /
            ``conaffinity`` suppression can leave empty under a payload that is
            demonstrably resting on a surface.
        evidence_ref: Optional trace/contact reference.
        stamp_ns: Producer timestamp. With ``support_id`` this keys the safety
            kernel's re-arm check, so a witness that already died after
            separation stays dead until a genuinely new one is attested.

    The second observable on the place path (ADR-0100, Path C): force is what
    distinguishes "set down" from "crush" once position clearance hits zero.
    The gate this feeds only ever adds a refusal — never widens an ADR-0097
    allowance or moves a margin. ``magnitude_n`` is Newtons only when
    ``magnitude_calibrated`` (no published work validates MuJoCo contact
    force against real F/T measurements; FORGE arXiv:2408.04587 re-tunes on

    * ``data`` carries the pixel bytes for in-process delivery and for trace
      capture. JSON-serialized as base64 by Pydantic, so payloads round-trip
      through ``model_dump_json`` / ``model_validate_json``.
    * ``topic`` points at a ROS 2 topic — the bytes live on the ROS 2 bus and

      carries. ``Ros2ImageSensorReader`` does NOT return this shape: it
      subscribes on the caller's behalf and inlines the decoded pixels as
      ``data``, because every ``read_latest`` consumer (the VLA observation
      builder, trace capture, the republishing sensor leg) needs the bytes,
      not a second subscription.
    * ``handle`` is an opaque integer (e.g. CUDA NVMM pointer, DMA-BUF file
      descriptor) — in-process only, never serialized. Set by the
      ``GStreamerSensorReader`` when frames stay on the GPU.

    Attributes:
        sensor_id: Sensor name; matches ``SensorSpec.name``.
        stamp_monotonic_ns: Capture-time monotonic timestamp in nanoseconds.
        stamp_wall_ns: Capture-time wall-clock timestamp in nanoseconds.
        encoding: How to interpret the bytes.
        width: Image width in pixels.
        height: Image height in pixels.
        channels: Number of channels (3 for RGB/BGR, 1 for MONO/DEPTH).
        data: Optional inline pixel payload (or compressed bytes for
            ``JPEG`` / ``PNG``). Mutually exclusive with ``topic`` /
            ``handle``.
        topic: Optional ROS 2 topic reference. Mutually exclusive with

            LIBERO checkpoints want this on; the RoboCasa checkpoints
            published by RoMALab / DAVIAN-Robotics want it off.

            reversal) BEFORE any 180° rotation. Mirrors
            ``robocasa.wrappers.gym_wrapper.RoboCasaGymEnv.process_img``,

            and its lerobot-converted siblings; the RoMALab MG_300
            checkpoint does NOT want this flip.
        input_template: Format string used to name image tensors in the
            policy input batch — for example ``"observation.images.{cam}"``
            for SmolVLA / pi05 RoMALab vs ``"observation.image.{cam}"``
            for ruiname/pi05-robocasa-10tasks-200k.
        aliases: Per-checkpoint rename map from the *scene* / *robot* raw
            camera key (e.g. robosuite's ``robot0_agentview_left_image``)
            to the *model*'s expected input feature name (e.g.
            ``agentview``). Empty means pass through unchanged. SmolVLA
            LIBERO usually wants ``{"camera1": "image", "camera2": "image2"}``.
        norm_tag: Normalization statistics tag for policies that use
            multiple checkpoints or training distributions (e.g. MolmoAct2
            with ``norm_tag="so100_so101_molmoact2"`` for SO-100/101
            finetuned weights). Optional; ``None`` means the adapter's
            default tag applies. Used by ``predict_action`` methods to
            select the right norm_stats entry at inference time.
        image_max_crops: Cap on the number of image tiles a multi-crop
            image processor (Molmo / MolmoAct2 family) produces per camera
            frame. Each extra 378px crop adds ~182 pooled image tokens and
            attention cost is quadratic in the token count, so this is the
            primary *activation*-memory lever (the NF4 weights are fixed at
            ~3.5 GiB; what overflows an 8 GiB card is the crop activations).
            Optional; ``None`` keeps the checkpoint's own default (8 for
            MolmoAct2). A per-rollout ``vla.extra["image_max_crops"]`` (or
            the ``OPENRAL_MOLMOACT2_MAX_CROPS`` env) still overrides this
            per-checkpoint default. Must be ``>= 1`` when set.
        resize_width: Exact checkpoint input width. When set with
            ``resize_height``, adapters resize the source frame before
            policy inference. This lets a high-resolution detector feed coexist
            with a policy trained at a lower native render size.

    The skill_runner reads ``ActionContract.slots`` and emits one
    typed ``Action`` per non-discard slot per step. All actions
    inherit the parent step's ``trace_id`` so the safety supervisor
    and downstream telemetry can join them post-hoc.

    Attributes:
        range: Inclusive ``[start, end]`` indices into the flat policy
            action vector. ``range[0]`` must be ≤ ``range[1]``; both
            must fall within ``[0, ActionContract.dim)``.
        control_mode: The ``ControlMode`` the slice is routed to.
            The HAL whitelist on the target robot must include this
            mode (the palette filter rejects the rSkill at install
            time otherwise). ``None`` only when ``discard`` is
            ``True``.
        discard: When ``True`` the slice is dropped silently — used
            for dataset artefacts like RoboCasa365's torso
            placeholder dim or paired gripper channels. The slot
            still occupies its range so coverage validation works;
            no ``Action`` is emitted.
        ee: End-effector name from the robot's
            ``RobotDescription.end_effectors`` /
            ``RobotDescription.joints``. REQUIRED for
            ``CARTESIAN_*`` modes (the pose is computed in the named

            FORBIDDEN for joint-position and gripper modes.

            order. REQUIRED for ``JOINT_POSITION`` / ``JOINT_VELOCITY``
            / ``JOINT_TORQUE`` when the slot covers fewer than all
            robot joints; FORBIDDEN for non-joint modes. Length must
            equal ``range[1] - range[0] + 1``.
        input_bounds: Optional inclusive controller-input bounds. The
            skill runner clips this slot before safety and HAL dispatch,

class ActionContract(BaseModel):
    """Per-rSkill action-vector contract.

    Mirrors ``StateContract`` for the action side. Carries the
    output dimensionality the checkpoint emits so the dataset bridge
    (and any downstream consumer) can bind the LeRobot v3 ``action``
    feature shape without consulting the sim or hardware adapter.

    The sim-specific action contract belongs on the
    per-checkpoint rSkill manifest, not on the physical
    ``RobotDescription`` (the same Franka emits 7-D delta-EEF on
    LIBERO vs 8-D joint pos on a hardware deploy).

    Attributes:
        dim: Dimensionality of the action vector emitted by
            ``Skill.step()`` / ``PolicyAdapter.step()``. Required when
            this contract is set.
        representation: Optional named representation (mirrors
            ``ActionSpec.representation``). When set, downstream
            consumers can map between equivalent representations
            (e.g. ``joint_positions`` → ``delta_ee_6d_plus_gripper``).
        slots: Declarative slot layout. When set, every
            index in ``[0, dim)`` must be covered by exactly one
            ``ActionSlot`` (no gaps, no overlaps). The
            skill_runner reads this to dispatch slices of the policy
            vector onto typed ``Action`` objects. When ``None``,
            the runner falls back to the legacy single-Action path
            (one implicit ``JOINT_POSITION`` slot covering the whole
            vector). Manifests carrying ``slots`` are exempt from the
            ``dim <= len(robot.joints)`` invariant because
            the slot decoder gives a typed contract per slice instead.
        cartesian_delta_scale: Per-axis physical range for a normalized
            Cartesian controller. Predictive safety applies
            ``clip(raw, -1, 1) * scale``. ``None`` means identity (the policy

class SceneTaskSpace(BaseModel):
    """The action interface a scene-adapter family executes.

    The scene leg of the cross-layer task-space contract. A scene picks a
    *backend adapter* (LIBERO OSC, RoboCasa composite, gym-aloha joints, the
    RLBench PyRep sidecar, …) and that adapter — not the coarse
    ``PhysicsBackend`` and not the individual scene instance — fixes which
    ``ControlMode`` s the policy's flat action vector is interpreted as.
    Many scenes share one adapter (the four LIBERO suites, RoboCasa's ~100
    prebuilt PnP tasks), so the executed task space is declared once per
    *family* and keyed by the same vocabulary rSkills already use in
    ``RSkillManifest.evaluated_tasks`` (the leading token before any
    ``"/"``: ``"libero_spatial"``, ``"rlbench"``, ``"robocasa"``, …).

        action_dim: The flat action-vector width the adapter steps, when fixed
            (LIBERO 7, MetaWorld 4, ALOHA 14). ``None`` when it varies by task
            or robot composition (RoboCasa 11-vs-12 base skew, ManiSkill

    how it encodes the gripper. Today these are assumed at the adapter
    level and silently broken when porting a skill between embodiments.

    The block is REQUIRED on every actuator entry of a manifest. For

``"any"`` is the *declared* way to say "this rSkill runs on every embodiment":
perception kinds (``detector`` / ``vlm`` / ``reward``) and ``playbook``
decision procedures use ``embodiment_tags: ["any"]``. An empty ``embodiment_tags``
is rejected by ``RSkillManifest._check_embodiment_tags_present`` — agnosticism
must be declared, never derived from an empty list (CLAUDE.md §1.4). The rSkill↔robot
gate (``openral_rskill.loader.rSkill.check_embodiment_tags``) treats ``"any"`` in a
skill's tags as match-any; a robot never declares ``"any"``.

``"mobile_base"`` is a CLASS tag (not a specific robot): any robot with a planar
base + ``body_twist`` actuator declares it so base-only rSkills (Nav2
NavigateToPose, etc.) can target the whole class without naming each specific
mobile platform. Robot-specific tags (e.g. ``"panda_mobile"``) coexist on the
same ``RobotDescription`` for skills that DO depend on the specific composition.

The ``RSkillManifest.embodiment_tags`` field is restricted to this set so a
typo or framework hint (``lerobot``, ``libero``) cannot land in a manifest
where the loader's compat check would silently never match. When
``"custom"`` is used, the manifest MUST also populate
``embodiment_extra`` (see ``EmbodimentExtra``); the cross-validator
on ``RSkillManifest`` enforces this.

Used by the eval / runner adapters to dispatch to the right
``openral_sim.adapters.<family>`` policy adapter without
string-matching the skill name. Adding a family here means landing the
matching adapter under ``python/sim/src/openral_sim/adapters/``.

``xr1`` (Xiaomi Robotics XR-1 / ``MiBoTForActionGeneration``) runs
out-of-process because its released checkpoints pin transformers 4.57.1
and FlashAttention 2.8.3 (the sidecar installs torch 2.9.1 rather than
upstream's 2.8.0, which publishes no linux-aarch64 wheel). The adapter consumes the
three public benchmark checkpoints; the bare 5B ``model_states.pt`` is
a post-training seed, not an executable policy.

``gr00t`` (NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1.x / N2) runs out-of-process via a ZMQ
sidecar in an isolated Python 3.10 venv, sharing the architecture of the
``rldx`` adapter (RLDX-1 is itself a GR00T-N1.5 finetune).

``lingbot_vla2`` (Robbyant LingBot-VLA 2.0, Qwen3-VL-4B backbone + sparse-MoE
flow-matching action expert, Apache-2.0 code + weights) runs out-of-process
via a ZMQ sidecar in its own Python 3.12 + torch-2.9.1 venv — the upstream
``lingbotvla`` package pins ``torch==2.8.0`` / ``transformers==4.57.3`` +
custom Triton MoE kernels, incompatible with the workspace transformers>=5
(the torch half of that pin set is overridden to 2.9.1 because 2.8.0 has no
linux-aarch64 wheel; adapter: ``openral_sim.policies.lingbot_vla2``).

``lingbot_vla`` (Robbyant LingBot-VLA 1.0, 4B Qwen2.5-VL-3B backbone + a *dense*
Qwen2 flow-matching action expert; paper "A Pragmatic VLA Foundation Model",
arXiv 2601.18692) is the RoboTwin post-train checkpoint. It shares the v2
sidecar transport + adapter but loads from the separate V1 upstream repo
(``github.com/robbyant/lingbot-vla``) in its own ``transformers==4.51.3`` /
``lerobot==0.4.2`` venv, driven by ``tools/_lingbot_vla2_server.py --variant v1``
(adapter: ``openral_sim.policies.lingbot_vla2`` id ``lingbot_vla``).

``lingbot_va_a1`` is the Galaxea A1 EEF deployment adapter for the LingBot-VA
checkpoint. It connects to versioned local Camera Bridge and policy-gateway
services owned by the separately maintained A1 Runtime, without importing its
checkout. Runtime owns the exact model configuration, EEF transforms, cache
semantics, and IK; OpenRAL validates the gateway identity and returns its
joint/gripper proposals through the normal safety and HAL path.

``openvla`` (OpenVLA / OpenVLA-OFT) is a transformers *custom-code* model
loaded in-process (``trust_remote_code``, gated by
``OPENRAL_ALLOW_REMOTE_CODE=1``); the adapter de-normalizes the policy's
discrete action tokens with the checkpoint's embedded ``unnorm_key`` stats
and replays the action chunk closed-loop.

``internvla_n1`` (InternRobotics InternVLA-N1 / DualVLN, arXiv:2512.08186) is
a dual-system vision-language NAVIGATION policy (Qwen2.5-VL-7B System-2 +
NavDP DiT System-1). Upstream InternNav pins ``transformers==4.51.0`` —
incompatible with the workspace — so it runs out-of-process via the same ZMQ
sidecar architecture as ``rldx``. The adapter consumes RGB-D + instruction
and emits a 6-D ``BODY_TWIST`` velocity command for a mobile base.

``rsl_rl_onnx`` is a proprio-only Isaac Lab / Unitree **rsl-rl ONNX**
locomotion family (not a vision-language policy, and not SmolVLA). The
adapter ``openral_sim.policies.rsl_rl_onnx`` loads ``policy.onnx`` plus
the checkpoint's ``params/deploy.yaml``, builds the rsl-rl observation
from HAL / world-state proprio + a ``policy_extras`` velocity command
(overridable per ``execute_rskill`` via ``goal_params_json`` or
``VLASpec.extra`` without editing the rSkill YAML),
and emits 12-D ``JOINT_POSITION`` targets. First customer:
``diasAiMaster/unitree-go2-velocity-flat`` (45-D). Second:
``rskills/rsl-rl-onnx-go2-hop-flat`` (mjlab hop, 470-D history-10;
ONNX fetched via ``onnx_url``, license unknown). Third:
``rskills/rsl-rl-onnx-go2-spring-jump`` (gym spring_jump, same 470-D
width, frame-major + joystick A; dashboard hop Apply). The reasoner prompt

  forbidden. ``chunk_size`` is pinned to ``1`` so the safety supervisor's
  per-row check sees every commanded position.
* ``"ros_service"`` — wraps an existing ROS 2 service. Same constraints as
  ``"ros_action"``.
* ``"detector"`` — perception producer that runs an exported detection model
  (RT-DETR / D-FINE ONNX) on the camera tee and publishes
  ``ObjectsMetadata``; emits no

* ``"segmenter"`` — perception producer that answers a **geometric** prompt
  (a point, or a small set of positive/negative points, in pixel coordinates)
  with a binary mask over the current camera frame. Unlike ``"detector"`` it
  carries no label vocabulary and no score threshold: it does not say *what*
  the pixels are, only *which* pixels belong to the prompted thing. Its

  perception component (e.g. Qwen3.5-4B NF4). Accepts RGB image or video
  frames and a natural-language query; returns a text answer. Emits no
  actions or bounding boxes. Runs at S2 rate (``role: "s2"``), so it is

    Attributes:
        CONTINUOUS: An always-on background producer. Runs on the camera tee
            every frame and streams ``ObjectsMetadata`` into
            ``WorldState.detected_objects``; the reasoner reads it **passively**
            (via world state / ``recall_object``) and never prompts it. It is
            **not** an ExecuteRskill-dispatchable tool and carries no actuation
            authority. RT-DETR (closed vocab) and OmDet-Turbo (frozen open
            vocab) are continuous. The reasoner may still toggle it via
            ``LifecycleTransitionTool`` to free VRAM.
        ON_DEMAND: A prompted locator the reasoner invokes only when it needs
            to find a specific object **right now**. Surfaces the read-only
            ``locate_in_view`` tool backed by an open-vocabulary
            detector; it is not run continuously. LocateAnything is on-demand.

    The two modes cleanly separate "open-vocabulary" from "prompting":
    continuous detectors cover a fixed bank of classes the reasoner reads for
    free; the on-demand locator handles the long tail that bank does not cover.

    The sibling of ``DetectorContract`` for models that answer a

    "where are the cups?" and replies with labelled, scored boxes; a
    segmenter is asked "what is the extent of the thing under *this
    pixel*?" and replies with a mask. It carries **no** ``labels`` and
    **no** ``score_threshold`` — it never classifies, and its consumer
    never gates on model confidence.

    That is a safety property, not an oversight: the mask feeds the HAL's
    vision attachment-evidence producer, which turns masked depth into the
    collision payload a manipulator plans around. Only geometry (containment
    between the jaws, payload extent, depth validity) can reject a bad mask;
    a measured instance of a 59.8%-of-frame mask returned at the model's own
    top score of 0.977 is what removed ``score_threshold`` from this

    Required when ``RSkillManifest.kind`` is ``"segmenter"``; forbidden for

    to decide whether to continue, escalate to a scene VLM, advance, or replan.

    Attributes:
        progress_range: ``(min, max)`` of the normalized per-frame progress
            scalar. Default ``(0.0, 1.0)`` — Robometer's discrete/binned mode
            (see ``num_bins``) emits progress already in ``[0, 1]``.
        success_threshold: Per-frame success probability at/above which the
            frame is considered a task success. In ``[0.0, 1.0]``; default
            ``0.5``.
        preference: Whether the model also exposes a trajectory-preference
            head (Robometer does). Default ``False`` — the progress/success
            path is the Reasoner-facing contract; preference is future work.
        backend: Which reward runtime scores this skill. ``"robometer"``
            (default) → the fine-tuned Robometer RewardModel in-process;
            ``"topreward"`` → the zero-shot TOPReward monitor (lerobot

            ``P("True" | video, instruction)``), run in-process. Selects the
            backend in ``build_reward_monitor``; existing manifests default to
            ``"robometer"`` so behavior is unchanged.
        frame_window_s: Length of the rolling frame buffer in seconds. The node
            evicts frames older than this relative to the newest. Must be > 0.
        target_fps: Frame-sampling rate fed to the model (Robometer's example
            uses 3 fps). Must be > 0. This is an S2-cadence monitor, not a
            per-control-step signal.
        num_bins: Discrete-mode bin count for the progress head. Robometer's
            discrete mode yields per-frame normalized progress in ``[0, 1]``;
            continuous mode yields raw regression values. Must be > 0;
            default ``100``.
        instruction_required: Whether a natural-language task instruction must
            accompany the frames (Robometer requires one). Default ``True``.
        check_floor: Below this progress value the attempt is clearly not done
            → no VLM adjudication, straight to the replanning ladder. Must be
            ≤ ``success_threshold``; default ``0.4`` (calibrated for robometer's
            loose/general eval distribution that wanders ~0.55-0.78).
        plateau_window_s: Trailing window (seconds) over which
            ``progress_trend ≈ 0`` indicates the policy has stopped getting
            closer to the goal. Default ``3.0``.
        plateau_tolerance: ε band absorbing critic noise when deciding whether
            the trend is flat. Default ``0.05``.

# ── rSkill HF-repo naming convention ────────────────────────────────────────
# Enforced published-repo shape (CLAUDE.md §3 rSkill packaging), ratified by the
# org naming audit:
#
#   <owner>/rskill-<model>-<robot>-<task>-<quant>       (weight-bearing kinds)
#   <owner>/rskill-<model>-<robot>-<task>               (ros_action / ros_service)
#   <owner>/rskill-playbook-<name>                      (kind == "playbook")
#
# Grammar rules:
# - Hyphens are ONLY the segment separators; every token uses underscores
#   internally. So a name parses by a plain ``split("-")`` into exactly 5 parts
#   (``rskill`` + 4 segments) — no anchored vocab matching needed.
# - Each segment matches ``^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_]*$``.
# - ``<model>`` ∈ ``CANONICAL_MODEL_TOKENS`` (a versioned checkpoint token,
#   NOT the bare ``ModelFamily``, so future gr00t_n2 / rldx2 don't collide).
# - ``<robot>`` ∈ ``CANONICAL_ROBOT_NAME_TOKENS`` (the ``EmbodimentTag``
#   values — includes ``"any"`` and ``"multi"`` for skills that declare >1
#   concrete robot).
# - ``<task>`` is AUTHOR-CHOSEN — validated by shape only, never by equality
#   against ``evaluated_tasks`` (that collapses e.g. so101 "pen" vs
#   "pick_place_pen", or omdet "indoor" vs "locator"). ``expected_repo_name``
#   only *suggests* a default task slug.
# - ``<quant>`` ∈ ``CANONICAL_QUANT_TOKENS``. ``int4`` weights ship as
#   bitsandbytes NF4, so the schema dtype ``int4`` maps to the token ``nf4``.
#   Weightless wrappers (``ros_action`` / ``ros_service``) OMIT ``<quant>``.
# - When ``model_family`` is set (VLA skills), the ``<model>`` token must also be
#   family-consistent — in ``_MODEL_FAMILY_ALLOWED_TOKENS`` for that family —
#   so a smolvla checkpoint can't be mislabelled ``pi05``.

    the cell the kernel *reported*, ``sweep_min_distance_m`` the depth of the

    witness exempted a deeper cell, which makes their inequality the

        task_success_steps: Simulator steps the episode ran.
        task_success_transitions: Success-predicate transitions observed.
        stop: The kernel's verdict, when the run was stopped.
        ground_truth: Adjudication of that stop against the simulator.
        witness: The attach / witness / declaration lifecycle.
        monitor_records: How many records the run's monitor wrote from a ROS
            subscription — every line except its own ``monitor_started`` /
            ``monitor_stopped`` pair. ``None`` when no monitor JSONL exists.

            client, verbatim — or, when the dispatcher died before writing a
            status line at all, why it did.
        wall_s: Wall-clock seconds the dispatch took.
        artifacts: Round-relative paths of the files this verdict was derived
            from, so every field is traceable to a file.
        harness_error_reason: Why the run produced no usable artifact set —
            the graph never came up, or the deploy CLI rejected its own argv.
            Non-empty exactly when ``outcome`` is ``harness-error``, so a

# Design notes:
#   - The registry pattern (string ids ↔ Python factories) keeps these specs
#     fully serialisable and YAML-friendly while letting backend code live in

#   - Backends (LIBERO, MetaWorld, ...) are imported lazily by the factory;
#     the schemas have no hard dependency on physics packages.
#   - ``SimEnvironment`` itself does NOT bake in a specific physics engine —

    unchanged, so this class does not constitute a schema migration
    (CLAUDE.md §1.6).

    Attributes:
        mode: ``"prebuilt"`` (default) or ``"procedural"``.
        prebuilt_task: One of RoboCasa's ~100 atomic task names, e.g.
            ``"PnPCounterToCab"``. Only valid when ``mode="prebuilt"``.
        kitchen_style: 0..9, picks one of RoboCasa's 10 kitchen aesthetic
            packs. Only valid when ``mode="procedural"``.
        layout_id: 0..9, picks one of RoboCasa's 10 floor plans. Only
            valid when ``mode="procedural"``.
        fixtures: Subset of RoboCasa fixture names to spawn. Empty list
            keeps the layout's default fixtures.
        spawn_objects: Subset of RoboCasa object asset names to spawn on
            counters / inside cabinets.
        task_verb: Coarse procedural-mode goal: pick-and-place, open,
            close, press, navigate. Required when ``mode="procedural"``.
        robots: RoboCasa robot composition names, e.g.
            ``["PandaMobile"]`` (default) or ``["GR1"]``. Must match
            entries the upstream RoboCasa env factory accepts.
        controller: RoboCasa controller name. ``"OSC_POSE"`` works for
            arm-style robots; the adapter validates against the
            controller config exposed by RoboCasa at import time.
        horizon: Maximum step budget for the underlying RoboCasa env.

    Example:
        >>> opts = RoboCasaBackendOptions(mode="prebuilt", prebuilt_task="PnPCounterToCab")
        >>> opts.task_verb is None

class TaskSpec(BaseModel):
    """A task declaration — WHAT the robot must achieve inside a scene.

    Tasks decouple scene assets (``SceneSpec``) from goal-conditioning. The
    same scene can host many tasks; the same task can occasionally be run in
    multiple compatible scenes (rare; usually 1:1 with ``scene_id``).

    Success is evaluated by the scene adapter — the reward / success signal
    comes from the underlying gym env (``info['is_success']``,
    ``info['success']``, terminal reward, …).  ``success_key`` lets manifest
    authors override which info field the runner reads.

    Attributes:
        id: Stable task identifier, e.g. ``"libero_spatial/task_0"``,
            ``"metaworld/push-v3"``.  Adapters split on ``/`` to resolve.
        scene_id: ID of the ``SceneSpec`` this task runs in.
        instruction: Natural-language goal handed to the VLA as the
            ``"task"`` text input.  Some adapters override this with a
            description baked into the underlying suite (LIBERO, MetaWorld).
        max_steps: Episode budget. Adapters may clip to scene-internal limits.
            ``None`` means unset; ``BenchmarkScene`` enforces a concrete value
            via its model validator.
        success_key: Key inside ``info`` returned by ``env.step()`` whose
            truthy value marks task success. ``None`` means unset;
            ``BenchmarkScene`` enforces a concrete value via its model
            validator (required for paper-comparison benchmarks).

    Attributes:
        id: Adapter id in the eval registry, e.g. ``"smolvla"``, ``"pi05"``,
            ``"xvla"``, ``"random"``, ``"zero"``. Picks the loader.
        weights_uri: Where to fetch weights from. Pass a bare rSkill

        device: Torch device override. ``"auto"`` picks ``cuda:0`` if

            default" (e.g. an URDF's identity placement). Only honoured by

        seed: Global random seed (env reset, action sampling, torch RNG).

#
# This introduces a hardware inference runner: the loop that closes
# ``WorldState → Skill.step → HAL.send_action`` at a cadence, mirroring the
# sim ``SimRunner`` for hardware. The schemas below are the on-disk
# contract for ``openral deploy --config <yaml>`` (sibling of ``openral sim run``) and
# the in-process record returned by the runner.
#
# These schemas are additive — they do not change ``SimEnvironment``,
# ``RSkillEvalResult``, or any pre-existing model. ``SensorFrame`` and
# ``FrameEncoding`` are declared earlier in this file because
# ``WorldState.image_frames`` references them.

            object / occupancy region (world-collision).
        horizon_step: Chunk step (horizon index) where the collision was first
            detected, or ``REACTIVE_HORIZON_STEP`` (``-1``) when the hit is a
            REACTIVE one — the robot's *measured* configuration already
            collides, so no prediction step is involved. The C++ safety kernel
            emits ``-1`` for that check (``check_config(q_meas, -1)`` in
            ``cpp/openral_safety_kernel/src/lifecycle_kernel.cpp``); it is the
            common case for Cartesian control modes, whose reactive
            measured-state check is the guaranteed floor.
        min_distance_m: Signed minimum distance at detection, in metres
            (negative means interpenetration).
        joint_positions_rad: The configuration the kernel ran forward
            kinematics on for ``horizon_step`` — the exact vector handed to
            ``forward_kinematics``, in the envelope's dof order, with mobile-base
            dofs zeroed (the kernel checks the arm in ``base_link``). This is
            what makes a stop adjudicatable: a *predicted* step's configuration
            exists in no other artifact, because it depends on the kernel's own
            damped-least-squares Jacobian, its lambda and its seed dt — so
            replaying such a stop against the measured joints reads geometry the
            kernel never checked. Empty only on a record emitted before the field
            existed: a kernel that reports a collision has a collision model by
            construction, and its FK buffer is always ``n_dof`` long.
        world_grid_origin_m: Base-frame position of voxel ``(0,0,0)``'s minimum
            corner in the occupancy grid **this check ran against**, when the
            other party is a world voxel; ``None`` otherwise and on any
            producer that predates the field. The kernel names its cell only
            as ``voxel_<n>``, an index into a grid it does not republish, so a
            consumer has to pair that index with a grid of its own — and the
            published window is snapped to the source lattice, so a base drift
            across one cell boundary shifts the whole window and the same index
            names a different cell. Matching on a stamp cannot separate two
            grids inside one clock tick (`/clock` quantises every stamp in the
            graph to the tick); matching on this origin is exact.

    the value is then dispatched onto the ROS graph (action client,

    Variants intentionally hold **no authority over actuation**: the
    reasoner never publishes ``ActionChunk`` itself.
    ``ExecuteRskillTool`` is
    indirect — it sends an action goal to ``rskill_runner_node`` which
    in turn produces the chunk and gates it through ``safety_node``.

    * **populate** (``target_task_id`` empty) — build a fresh mission queue from
      ``subtasks``, refining the single-task seed when the operator goal needs a
      finer decomposition than a single prompt.
    * **subdivide** (``target_task_id`` set) — *flat-splice* the named blocked
      task in place with ``subtasks`` (``t2 → t2.1, t2.2``), bounded by
      ``DEFAULT_MAX_SUBDIVIDE_DEPTH``; past the
      bound the node hands off instead.

    Each subtask is a ``GroundedSubtask`` (one specific object),
    not a free string — so a collective "first batch of objects" cannot be
    emitted. The node renders them to ``MissionState`` task text via
    ``rendered_subtasks``.

    Like every ``ReasonerToolCall`` variant it **holds no authority over
    actuation** — it only edits the S2 task ledger; a bad
    decomposition yields a worse plan the safety kernel still vetoes.

    Attributes:
        tool: Discriminator (always ``"decompose_mission"``).
        subtasks: Ordered, non-empty list of ``GroundedSubtask`` — each acts
            on exactly one specific object and becomes a ``TaskState``.
        target_task_id: ``TaskState.task_id`` of the blocked task to subdivide
            (e.g. ``"t2"``); empty string populates/replaces the whole queue.

    """Tool variant — deliberate no-op: observe and wait for the next tick.

    The reasoner's tool choice is forced (``tool_choice="any"`` /
    ``"required"``), so without this variant the LLM MUST act every tick even
    when the correct decision is "nothing to do yet" — e.g. a skill is mid-
    execution and progress is nominal, or the mission is finished and no new
    goal has arrived. Forcing an action in those states produces spurious
    read-only queries or operator-prompt spam. ``wait`` makes "do nothing this
    tick" an explicit, logged, traceable decision instead of a side effect.

    Dispatch: none. The node records the call (rationale included) on the
    reasoner span and returns — no ROS traffic, no actuation, no state change.

"""Discriminated union over the reasoner tool variants.

The discriminator field is ``tool`` (a string ``Literal`` on each
variant), and it is declared as one: a malformed payload reports only
the errors of the variant it tagged itself as, instead of every
variant's. The caller always sets ``tool`` from the provider's function
name before validating (``openral_reasoner.tool_use``), so an untagged
payload is a bug in the caller, not a shape to guess at.

Consumers decode an LLM tool-use payload with::

    from pydantic import TypeAdapter
    from openral_core import ReasonerToolCall

    call = TypeAdapter(ReasonerToolCall).validate_json(payload)

Producers (LLM clients) serialise via ``call.model_dump_json()``.

Actuation/effect palette: ``ExecuteRskillTool``,
``ReloadGstPipelineTool``, ``LifecycleTransitionTool``,
``EmitPromptTool``, ``WaitTool``. Read-only query variants (no
actuation authority): ``RecallObjectTool``, ``ResolvePlaceTool``,
``LocateInViewTool``, ``QuerySceneTool``,
``QueryTaskProgressTool``, ``MemorySearchTool``. Write-to-memory:
``MemoryWriteTool``. S2-ledger-only: ``DecomposeMissionTool``
(populates/flat-splices ``MissionState``'s task queue, never actuation).

Extending the palette requires (a) a new variant here, (b) the corresponding
ROS-side dispatch in ``openral_reasoner_ros.reasoner_node``, (c) a CLAUDE.md
§6.2 / §7.6 amendment if the new tool shifts the reasoner's authority surface.
The query variants' dispatch + result-return path is wired separately; until
then they are a typed contract not yet exposed in the live provider palette.
